Safety and security of our students are of utmost importance, it is therefore necessary to reiterate the following points and we ask that you adhere to them.  

  

**Access to SMS(P)** – All visitors to the school will have to report at the Security Guard Post. This is for security and contact tracing purposes during emergencies. The only exception is when the different gates are opened at designated timing for morning drop off or dismissal pickup. 

  

**Morning Drop Off** – Parents/guardians who drive will need to enter and exit by Gate 1 (along Mattar Road) after dropping off your child/ward within the school grounds when the gates open at 6.30 am. However, from 6.45 am onwards, you will need to drive through to the Parade Square to drop off your child/ward before leaving by Gate 3 (leading to Aljunied Road). This is to minimise any bottleneck at Gate 1 as traffic is expected to pick up from 6.45 am. We seek your understanding and cooperation to follow our road marshals’ direction to ensure a smooth and hassle free traffic flow. You can also choose to drop off your child/ward at Gate 4 (near HDB blocks 125 & 126).

  

**Dismissal Pick up** – For the usual afternoon dismissal, parents/guardians who drive will have access to school compound from 1.50 pm onwards or after the school buses have vacated the compound to pick up your child/ward from the parade square. For late afternoon pickup after supplementary, remedial and CCA; the pick-up points will be at foyer from 4.10 pm. The exit point will be by Gate 3.

  

For pick up at Gates 1 (main entrance), 2 (Upp Aljunied Rd) and 4 (near HDB blocks 125 & 126), parents/guardians are reminded to be punctual. Gates 2 and 4 will be locked at 1.50 pm (early afternoon pickup) and 4.20 pm (late afternoon pick up). After these timings, all pick up and exit from school will be confined to only Gate 1. Do be prepared to be stopped for security clearance.

  

For the safety of students especially the P1 and P2, they should be accompanied by an adult or older sibling when leaving the school grounds.

  

Listed below are the opening hours of the various school gates:
