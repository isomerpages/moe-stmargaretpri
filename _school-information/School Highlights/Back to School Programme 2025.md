### **Back to School Programme 2025**

##### 3 - 10 Jan 2025

Our Back to School (BTS) programme is thoughtfully designed to warmly welcome our students and help them transition smoothly into the new academic year with confidence and excitement. Teachers and staff greeted each student with warm smiles, guiding them through the schedule and introducing them to their new environment.  Through a series of engaging icebreaker activities, including learning journeys, team-building games, class bonding exercises and informative sessions, students are given the opportunity to strengthen their relationships with both peers and teachers. A key highlight of the programme is the school tour around our newly built compound.  

##### New school compound

The school’s sleek new building stands as a testament to growth and change, offering spacious classrooms, state-of-the-art labs, and open areas for outdoor activities. New additions designed to meet the evolving needs of teaching and learning include an indoor sports hall, a sheltered parade square, a computer lab, IT learning resource room, pastoral care and counselling room and a health and fitness room. A unique space has been dedicated as our ‘Heritage Room’ to detail the long-standing history of our school. Our new school compound features more spaces for interaction which creates an environment that fosters collaboration and engagement. The school is also fully networked for internet access, enabling teachers and students to utilize digital resources seamlessly. Additionally, the upgrades have made our school more accessible, with the addition of lifts and ramps ensuring that every student, regardless of mobility challenges, can navigate the school with ease. These enhancements aim to provide a holistic and supportive learning environment for all.
