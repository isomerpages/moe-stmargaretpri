### One Earth Challenge 2024 - P4 level

##### 8 - 9 April 2024

The primary 4 level participated in OneEarth Challenge (OEC), a joint venture with LTA and Living Theories. OEC is a fun and interactive programme that promotes positive ‘Walk, Cycle, Ride’ behaviour in our children and to reduce traffic congestion around our schools. It aims to create a safer, cleaner and brighter environment.

Our primary 4 Eco-stewards played an active role in the daily check-in to report the mode of transport and encouraging their peers to log in to OneEarth Digital World. The Masters of Ceremony successfully engaged the students and staff to participate actively. It was a resounding success with 94% unique check-in and our students are the most enthusiastic participants LTA had on the OEC! Our Top 3 winners were also invited to a Tree-planting ceremony.
