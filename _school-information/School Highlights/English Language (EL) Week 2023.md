EL Week 2023 – Celebrating Creativity and Sustainability
--------------------------------------------------------

EL Week is an annual school event in St Margaret’s School (Primary) planned by the English Language Department for our students and teachers. Activities during the week aim to promote a love for English Language, and to celebrate creativity in the use of the medium through enriched experiences beyond the textbooks.  
  
Back for the third year, EL Week 2023 was held from 25 to 27 January 2023. Our students wrote Haikus about the books/characters they enjoyed and created props/accessories/costumes using recycled materials for Book Character Day. On 27 January, the finale of EL Week, everyone had a whale of a time playing the character that we dressed up as.
