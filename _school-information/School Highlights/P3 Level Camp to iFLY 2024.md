### P3 Level Camp to iFLY 2024

##### 6 - 10 May 2024

The P3 cohort went to iFLY Singapore to experience indoor skydiving for their level camp in May. In this programme, the girls learnt from iFLY instructors and experienced indoor skydiving in a vertical wind tunnel which simulates the experience of freefall. 

The instructors brought the girls for a visit to the fan deck where they also learned the technology and functionality of the wind tunnel.
The Science teachers extended the girlsâ€™ learning by exploring the properties of the material used to make the skydiving suit and other safety gears.

After a flight safety training and a dry run of the basic belly fly position, the girls proceeded to gear up in the flight suits. With much guidance from the instructor, the girls stepped into the wind tunnel one at a time and had an amazing time experiencing indoor skydiving.
