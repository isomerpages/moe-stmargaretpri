### P4 Social Studies Learning Journey to Kreta Ayer Heritage Gallery (KAHG)

##### 24, 29 &amp; 30 March 2023


In March, the Primary 4 students went on a learning journey to Kreta Ayer Heritage Gallery as part of their Social Studies Museum-based Learning. The learning journey was facilitated by Museum Educators from the gallery. 

While they were there, the students explored features of five Chinese cultural arts (Chinese Opera, Chinese Puppetry, Chinese Calligraphy, Chinese Tea and Nanyin music) through hands-on activities, pictures and stories. The students enjoyed the novel experiences of being able to write with a brush pen and taking a whiff of the Chinese tea leaves.

They also went on a precinct walk in the wider Kreta Ayer area. The students were intrigued to learn about the stories behind some of the places in the area, such as the Jinrikisha Station and Sago Lane. 

From this learning journey, students learnt more about the contributions made by the Chinese community in the development of Singapore. It was indeed a fruitful experience!
