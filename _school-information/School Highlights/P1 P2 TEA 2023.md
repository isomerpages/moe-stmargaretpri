### Let’s have T.E.A.

##### 10 FEB, 16 FEB 2023

Our youngest students from P1 and P2 were treated to T.E.A. at the Victoria Theatre on 10 Feb and 16 Feb 2023. T.E.A stands for Theatre Exposure and Appreciaton. At St Margaret’s School (Pri), we believe in creating an immersive learning experience for our students as they acquire the English language. 

Theatre performances teach clear communication and spark children to imagine themselves in the roles of the characters, to imagine possible sequels, and to imagine what their own lives could become someday.

Our P1s watched The Tiger Who Came to Tea, a musical packed with oodles of magic, sing-a-long songs and clumsy chaos! Our P2s watched Stick Man which featured a trio of top actors and was packed full of puppetry, songs, live music and funky moves.

It was such a great experience as the girls watched the book characters come to live on stage!
