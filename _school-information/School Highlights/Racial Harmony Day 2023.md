### Racial Harmony Day 2023

####



Racial Harmony Day is a very special day when we make a conscious effort to create awareness amongst the students of the different ethnic traditions and cultures. More importantly, the respect and understanding of the different races were emphasized throughout the RHD week. There was collaboration between the Music, PE, EL department, and STAR CCA, to cultivate appreciation and understanding of various cultures as well as promote respect and harmony for each other despite the difference in race. For this yearâ€™s celebration, the school engaged Rhythm Masala, a percussion group, to perform for our students. Not only did the students enjoy the performance, but they also learned about the various types of traditional drums which they never knew before. Recess activities were also planned for the students. Parent and student volunteers helped to oversee the games and music stations, as well as the photo booth. Some students from STAR CCA were also given the opportunity to introduce the different aspects of RHD to the school before the start of each day. The teachers also engaged the students in class on Racial Harmony during CCE FTGP lessons. Through the various activities, we hope that our students understand the true meaning of Racial Harmony and would play their part to contribute towards building a strong community regardless of race.
