### P3 Learning Journey to Giant Hypermarket

##### 22 May 2023

The P3 students spent a fruitful and enjoyable day at the Giant Hypermarket to have a hands-on shopping experience!

The students were given tasks to complete and they had to make decisions on the best sugar, eggs and milk to use to make a cake. “Should we get the bigger packet or the smaller packet of sugar? Do we get white sugar or brown sugar? Should we get oat milk or full cream milk? Do we get cheaper ones or do we buy the most expensive ones?” The students were engaged in deep mathematical conversations with their teachers and classmates as they explored what items are best to purchase.



The students also explored food from other countries and learnt about currency. They also went on home later that day and explored food items in their own pantry that came from our neighbouring countries. 

The students were also given opportunities to read nutrition panels on cereal boxes and granola/muesli packets and understand more about healthier food choices. They also learnt about hidden sugar content in items that have been advertised as “healthy”.

Lastly, the students were able to purchase their own healthy snack with a budget of $5 and make the payment independently at the cashiers.

It was a meaningful day for the P3 students indeed!
