### Amazing Race

##### 

The South Zone cluster schools came together and conducted the S5 cluster Tamil competition for the P5 students. We selected a few primary five students to participate in the competition. Our girls had a great time working collaboratively with the students from other schools and participated in various activities. Our school also had an activity station in the amazing race. Students enjoyed those activities. 

This activity gave them an opportunity to learn about aspects of Indian culture and tradition, and the Tamil language. Our students participated in the competition and won various medals.
