### **P4 Social Studies Learning Journey to Kreta Ayer Heritage Gallery (KAHG)**

##### 19 &amp; 26 March, 2 April 2024

In the months of March and April, our Primary 4 students embarked on an educational adventure to the Kreta Ayer Heritage Gallery.

Guided by the knowledgeable Museum Educators from the National Heritage Board, they immersed themselves in the rich tapestry of Chinese cultural arts. 

They explored the five captivating facets of Chinese cultural arts: Chinese Opera, Chinese Puppetry, Chinese Calligraphy, Chinese Tea and Nanyin Music.

Beyond the gallery walls, our students embarked on a precinct walk through the historic Kreta Ayer area. Through this enriching experience, they discovered the contributions of the Chinese community to Singaporeâ€™s vibrant heritage.
