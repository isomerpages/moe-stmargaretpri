Our P4 students participated in the P4 SEP on 30 August 2022. The objective of this programme is to expose students to sports beyond curriculum so that they can pick up the sports and lead a healthy lifestyle.

  

All P4 students had a 1-hour session learning Goalball from the instructor.  Goalball is one of the sports played in Paralympics. It is a team sport designed specifically for the athletes with vision impairment. The students had a fun and exhilarating time learning. They even had the privilege to hear a short sharing and learn from one of Singapore’s Paralympics Goalball team members!
