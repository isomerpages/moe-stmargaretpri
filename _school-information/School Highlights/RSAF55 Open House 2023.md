### RSAF55 Open House 2023

##### 8 Sep 2023

It was a bright and sunny afternoon. About 80 Primary 6 students stood ready to board the buses provided by the RSAF after a morning of supplementary lessons. They were raring to go for the RSAF55 Open House. It was a well-deserved break away from revising for the PSLE. When it was time, the students and teachers boarded the buses and headed for the Paya Lebar Air Base. At the air base, the students had the opportunity to explore the RSAF assets at the Static Display area, learn more about the history and future of the RSAF at the interactive displays at the exhibition halls, watch the Aerial Capability Display and be introduced to the Military Working Dogs.
