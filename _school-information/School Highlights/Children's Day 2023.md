### Children’s Day Celebration 2023

##### 5 Oct 2023

This year’s Children’s Day was celebrated on the 5 October 2023. Our theme for this year was “When I Grow Up……” The whole school had a wonderful celebration from recess activities by the Chapel of Christ the King (CCK) to classroom activities and hall celebrations. During their recess activities, the students were able to write down their dreams and create a hot air balloon craft work which can be brought home.

Our Primary 1 to Primary 4 students were brainstorming ideas on their class mascots to showcase what they would like to be when they grow up. It was so exciting seeing the different dressed up by the different classes. Our students were excited to see their teachers putting up a series of songs, dances, and games.

While the Primary 1 to Primary 4 students were having their classroom activites, our Primary 5 and Primary 6 students were in the hall playing captain’s ball with the teachers. It was a thrilling match, especially while playing against the teachers. Nonetheless, the girls played exceedingly well.

At the end of the celebration, every student went home with a tote bag specially chosen so they could use it for school daily. We hope the students had the most enjoyable day!
