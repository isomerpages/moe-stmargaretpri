### P3 Sports Education Programme

##### 2 March 2023


Our P3 students participated in the P3 SEP on 2 March 2023. The objective of this programme is encourage sports participation beyond the PE curriculum and expose our young ones to new sports, increasing their sporting opportunities.

All P3 students had a 1-hour session learning rebounding from an SEP accredited instructor.  Rebounding is a type of aerobic exercise that is performed while jumping on a mini-trampoline. The students had a fun-filled time working out to improve their balance, coordination, and overall motor skills.
