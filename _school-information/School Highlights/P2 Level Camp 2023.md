### P2 Level Camp 2023

##### 14 March 2023

Organised by the Primary 2 Maths and PE teachers, the Primary 2 girls embarked on an exciting learning trail that consisted of six learning stations. These learning stations were purposefully designed and set up at the open spaces within the school to capitalize on the benefits of outdoor play. 

The objectives of the trail are:<br>
1)	To help students appreciate Mathematics by giving them an opportunity to discover its application in real life situations.<br>
2)	To build on studentsâ€™ teamwork and foster stronger bonds through them completing the station tasks as a team.<br>
3)	To get students to engage in physical activities and apply skills that they have learnt in PE.

Each learning station had a different Mathematical focus and the topics included pattern, length, speed, time, addition, multiplication and visualization. To complete each station task, the girls were also required to jump, throw, balance and run. As the Primary 2 Camp drew to a close, the girls not only had a fun day of learning, but they had also learnt to collaborate with their team members while demonstrating the school values of charity, patience, lifelong learning, integrity, graciousness, humility and tenacity.
