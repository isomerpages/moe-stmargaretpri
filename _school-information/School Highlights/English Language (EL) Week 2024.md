### EL Week 2024 - Language of Love

##### 29 Jan - 2 Feb 2024

Our school embarked on a literary adventure as we celebrated English Week with the theme English is the Language of Love. It was a vibrant journey that showcased the creativity, imagination, and literary prowess of our students.

Throughout the week, our English classrooms were buzzing with activity as students immersed themselves in the magical world of acrostic poems, cinquains, and haikus. Our dedicated English teachers crafted engaging lessons that not only expanded vocabulary but also ignited a passion for expression through the art of language.

The National Library Board (NLB) staff joined us during Assembly 1 to share captivating stories on codes and ciphers. The excitement in the air was palpable as students tried to decipher hidden messages and unravel mysteries. Laughter, curiosity, and a love for stories filled the hall.

The grand finale of English Week, Book Character Day, was a spectacle to behold. From Matilda's mischievous grin to Willy Wonka's whimsical charm, the corridors echoed with the laughter and excitement of our students who truly brought their favourite stories to life.

What truly warmed our hearts was witnessing the ingenuity of our students during Book Character Day. Armed with creativity and a commitment to sustainability, they cleverly fashioned costumes and props using recyclable materials.

The joy, enthusiasm, and love for language displayed throughout the week are a testament to the vibrant spirit of our school. Our hope is that the love for language cultivated during English Week will continue to blossom in the hearts and minds of our students.
