### P1 Level Camp 2024

##### 1 March 2024

On March 1st, our Primary 1 students embarked on an exciting adventure as they participated in the P1 Level Camp, a collaborative effort between the Physical Education and English Language departments. 

At the heart of the camp was the introduction of cheerleading, a dynamic activity that encourages self-expression and fosters a sense of camaraderie. Led by enthusiastic instructors, our students delved into the fundamentals of cheerleading, learning exhilarating routines while strengthening bonds within their classes.

In addition to the thrilling cheerleading workshop, our students had the opportunity to unleash their artistic talents through pom pom making. Using a variety of craft materials, they crafted vibrant pom-poms, adding their personal touch to each creation.

As part of the English Language curriculum integration, students engaged in class cheer recitations, honing their language skills while expressing school spirit and unity. Through these activities, they discovered the joy of communication and the power of collective enthusiasm.

The P1 Level Camp served as a vibrant playground where imaginations ran wild, and creativity knew no bounds. It was a celebration of friendship, exploration, and the boundless potential within each of our students.
