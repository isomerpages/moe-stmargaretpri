### P5 Sports Education Programme (SEP)

Our P5 students participated in the P5 SEP on 29 August 2023. The objective of this programme is to expose students to sports beyond curriculum so that they can pick up the sports and lead a healthy lifestyle.

All P5 students had a 1.5-hour session learning Kinball from the instructor.  Unlike almost any other game on the planet, the game is not played in the traditional one-versus-one team or individual format, but it is played with three teams, all competing against each other to win at the same time. Each team is to catch and control the Kinball before it touches the ground. The students had a wonderful and thrilling time learning.
