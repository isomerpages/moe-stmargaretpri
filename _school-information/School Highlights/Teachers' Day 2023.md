### Teachers' Day Celebration 2023

##### 30 - 31 August 2023

Teachers’ Day 2023 was a special celebration for the teachers as we had two-day celebration!  It started on 30th August with a feast for our eyes, and ended with a feast for the teachers’ hearts. The celebration started with a mesmerizing concert. The theme of the concert this year was ‘Floral Paradise’ and indeed, the concert started off with a walk-in of the loveliest ‘flowers’ in our school – the teachers who were adorned in florals of all kinds, crowns of flowers on their heads, flower necklaces or bracelets- waving the flowers in their hands. The teachers sat down to an array of dazzling performances put on for them by the students who wanted to show their gratitude and appreciation for the teachers’ hard work and dedication. Melodious singing from the choir and the P2 girls filled the air as graceful dancers from the P3 glided across the stage while the fans of the Chinese Dance performers fluttered in the air. Friendly competitions between teachers and students took place amidst loud cheering from their respective supporters. Thus, concluded the first part of the Teachers’ Day celebration.      




The second part of Teachers’ Day celebration continued the next morning. Throngs of students could be seen bustling around the school, carrying loads of handmade gifts to present to their beloved teachers. Soon, the buzz of activity settled down, and the students celebrated the joyous occasion with their form teachers. During the classroom interaction activities, the students made paper bouquets and paper flowers to gift their teachers. They also had a fun time bonding with their teachers as they played games together. It was truly a memorable and joyous day for both teachers and students!
