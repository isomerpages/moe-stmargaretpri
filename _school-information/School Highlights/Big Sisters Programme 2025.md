### **Big Sisters Programme 2025**

To help the new Primary 1 students settle into their school routine, we have the Big Sisters Programme, where we pair two Primary 1 students with two Primary 4 students during the first two weeks of recess. This initiative gives an opportunity for the older students to guide the younger students through the daily routines, such as buying food from the canteen, navigating around the school, and engaging in fun activities after eating. The Primary 1 students quickly warmed up to their ‘Big Sisters’, enjoying their time together and feeling reassured by the guidance they received. The Primary 4 students, in turn, were delighted to embody the school’s values of Charity, Patience, and Devotion, as they supported the little ones. 

Through this programme, the Primary 1 students not only learned the ins and outs of school life but also developed self-care and social skills. This signature Big Sisters Programme is just one of the many ways we support the holistic development of our students, ensuring they kickstart the school year learning important self-management skills. The experience proved to be meaningful for both the Primary 1 and Primary 4 students, fostering long-lasting bonds and creating fond memories of school life. To show their gratitude, the Primary 1 students gave handmade ‘Thank You’ cards to their Primary 4 Big Sisters at the end of the Big Sisters Programme, marking a heartwarming conclusion to the orientation period.
