### SPOTLIGHT concert Fundraising Event 2024

##### 23 May 2024

The much-anticipated SPOTLIGHT Concert was a showcase of extraordinary talent and dedication. This yearâ€™s concert showcased a diverse array of performances, highlighting the hard work and resilience of our students. As they took to the stage, we celebrated not just their artistic achievements, but also their journey of perseverance through countless rehearsals and their participation in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation.

Interspersed throughout the concert, our talented narrators from the STAR CCA guided the audience through the mystical woodlands. Their eloquent storytelling and engaging presence  ensured an entertaining experience into the forest! The narrators have honed their skills in articulation and expression, making them integral to the concert's success.

The SPOTLIGHT Concert is more than just a showcase of talent; it is a celebration of the hard work and resilience that our students have demonstrated as students took ownership and played a role in raising funds for the PERI upgrading project. We are thankful to God for his mercies along the way!
