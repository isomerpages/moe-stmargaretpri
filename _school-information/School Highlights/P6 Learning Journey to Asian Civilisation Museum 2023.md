### P6 SS Learning Journey to Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM)

##### 15, 17 and 23 May 2023

In May, the Primary 6 students went on a learning journey to the Asian Civilisations Museum as part of their Social Studies Museum-based Learning. The learning journey was facilitated by the knowledgeable Museum Educators.

While they were there, the students viewed goods found in a shipwreck that was discovered in the region. They also deduced how trade around the Singapore River was like in the past after viewing some pictures of the objects found. The students learnt about some customs and traditions, and saw how people in Southeast Asia adapted to its climate and wildlife.

Through the stories shared, students understood the cultural and historical ties that had influence on the countries in Southeast Asia and explored how Singaporeâ€™s cultural heritage has evolved over time.
