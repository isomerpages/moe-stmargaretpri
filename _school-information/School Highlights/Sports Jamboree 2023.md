### Sports Jamboree 2023

##### 10 March 2023

This year the PE Team is organising ‘Sports Jamboree 2023’ to encourage healthy living by participating in physical sports and games as well as to give our students an opportunity to demonstrate skills they have learnt during PE lessons. In addition,close to 70 students leaders are owners of all the game stations in this Jamboree. In this Jamboree, we provide the students leaders to lead and serve, ‘Run By Students, For Students’!  

During the preparation, organising games as well as managing the game stations, the leaders will gain confidence as they hone their leadership abilities and stretch themselves to be effective leaders taking initiatives to trouble-shoot in various scenarios. The PE Team are delighted that the students had a rolling good time participating in this Jamboree.
