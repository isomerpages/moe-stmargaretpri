### P1 Learning Journey to MacPherson Wet Market and Food Centre 2023

##### 7, 9 and 10 Nov 2023

Ending the year on a high, the Primary 1 students and teachers went on a neighbourhood discovery walk. Along the way, students identified the different facilities and buildings found in a neighbourhood as part of the Social Studies syllabus.  

Arriving at our destination, students exchanged warm greetings and friendly smiles with residents enjoying their usual morning coffee. They were given the chance to apply their language skills to communicate with the stall-holders and numeracy skills to count money as they made a purchase. As the students walked through the wet market, they observed many stalls selling various food products like seafood, pork, dried goods, fruits and vegetables. It was an eye-opening experience for the students to observe the happenings in a wet market. For many of them, it was their first time in a wet market ever.

To take a break, students had a splendid outdoor picnic under the cool shade of a community pavilion to have a relaxing time with nature. Students had a fun time igniting love and forming bonds with classmates and teachers. Back in school, as a follow-up lesson, students reviewed the food items and products available in the wet market and hawker centre in their Mother Tongue languages.

Venturing outside the classroom, this learning journey enhanced studentsâ€™ mental and physical health and provided them a chance to learn beyond books. It was a truly extraordinary experience for the little ones.
