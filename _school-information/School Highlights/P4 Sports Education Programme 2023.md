### P4 Sports Education Programme (SEP)

##### 23 May 2023

The SEP for Primary 4 students was held on 23 May 2023. The objective of this programme is to expose students to sports beyond our PE curriculum to encourage sports participation in our school and increase sporting opportunities for our students.

All our P4 students had an one-hour session learning Goalball from the instructors.  Goalball is one of the sports played in Paralympics. It is a team sport designed specifically for the athletes with vision impairment.

The students tried to score points by throwing/rolling a ball that has bells embedded inside of it into the opponents' goal while being blindfolded. Apart from having fun and working as a team, they also learned to use their ear-hand coordination when playing this sport, and had a taste of how it is like to be visually impaired when they had to depend on their other senses (such as hearing and touch) to get hold of the ball.
