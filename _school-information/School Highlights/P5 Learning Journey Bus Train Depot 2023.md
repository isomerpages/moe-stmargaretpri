### P5 EL Learning Journey to Bus and Rail Depots 2023

##### 17 August (5G, 5H - Bus Depot)
##### 28 August (5C, 5I, 5T - Rail Depot)

Many of us take the public buses and trains to school every day. Have you ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes to ensure the smooth journeys we enjoy?

In August, the Primary 5 students had the opportunity to visit the Ulu Pandan Bus Depot and Sengkang Rail Depot, after learning about Singapore’s MRT system in their English lessons. They observed the behind-the-scenes operations of our public transport system and learnt about the essential roles and responsibilities of our public transport workers. 

At the Ulu Pandan Bus Depot, students learnt about some of the sustainability efforts put in place, such as the installation of solar panels. Then, they enjoyed a ride around the bus depot on a double decker bus, and experienced a ‘bus wash’.

At the Sengkang Rail Depot, students tried their hands at operating an MRT train through a train simulator activity. Additionally, they learnt about how the operations staff help to manage and coordinate the different train services. 

Some students were interviewed for a short video clip by the Land Transport Authority (LTA). They shared their experience at the depot and expressed their gratitude for all public transport workers. At the end of the learning journeys, tokens of appreciation were presented to the public transport workers.
From this learning journey, the Primary 5 students got a glimpse of what goes on behind the running of our public transport system. It was definitely an enriching experience for them!
