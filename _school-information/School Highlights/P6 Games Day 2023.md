### Games Day by P6 2023

##### 14 November 2023

In line with our School Vision – A Community of Learners Growing and Glowing for God, we continue to plan various VIA activities for our students so that they can learn to Be the LIGHT by reaching out to others and experiencing the joy of giving from a thankful heart. 

The P6 students were given the challenge to develop carnival games for their younger schoolmates to play on Games Day by P6. The event was part of the school’s efforts to raise funds for the PERI Upgrading Project (PUP).

Through the programme, the students learnt to put into practice skills they had learnt in primary school, such as working in teams, communicating with peers and schoolmates who are much younger. The school values, LIGHT, i.e. lifelong learning, integrity, graciousness, humility and tenacity came to life as the girls worked through the challenges faced to complete their games, and as they manned their game stalls throughout the school day.
