As part of the school’s 180th anniversary celebrations, the school carried out a level cheer competition in alignment with the anniversary theme, “Let Our LIGHT Shine” and the school motto and values. Each class took time to craft their very own version of the level cheer based on the value focus for the level. Classes took the opportunity to bond through practising and presenting their cheers through a video clip. Students had a chance to vote for the level cheer they thought would be most suitable through the Student Learning Space. Each level will make use of the winning cheer for the level as their very own level cheer to be used at level bonding activities such as camps. Congratulations to all the winners!
