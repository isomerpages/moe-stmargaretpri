### Celebrating Our Successes Day 2023

##### 17 November 2023

The emphasis for Celebrating Our Successes Day was on students’ progress and character development. This is in alignment with our school’s vision of holistic development through the building of a community of learners, growing and glowing for God. Our awards were categorised into three domains: The Confident Margarite Awards, The Lifelong Learner Awards & The Community Contributor Awards. Our Guest-of-honor, Reverend Bertram Cheong, graced the occasion. We were delighted to be able to have the parents of award recipients with us for the award ceremony held in the School Hall. We were treated to captivating performances by the members of the School Choir CCA and Chinese Dance CCA. Celebrating Our Successes Day was a great way to end our school academic year.
