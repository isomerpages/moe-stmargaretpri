### IFLY 

##### 8 &amp; 12 May 2023

For the Primary 3 camp, the PE department collaborated with the Science department to introduce the concept of flying. The girls went to IFLY Singapore to experience indoor skydiving.

In this programme, the girls experience the thrill of an actual skydive from 12000 feet without the heavy cost and risk of it. They also learned the functionality of the wind tunnel. 
The Science teachers also extended the girlsâ€™ learning by exploring the properties of the material used to make the skydiving suit and other safety gears.

The tour started with a video on the introduction to indoor skydiving and skydiving. This allowed the girls to understand the foundational information about it. This was followed by a visit to the fan deck. They went through a flight safety training and a dry run of the basic belly fly position. The girls proceeded to do warm-up exercises before gearing up in the flight suits and other safety equipment. After this, they took flight and practice their belly fly position in the wind tunnel!
