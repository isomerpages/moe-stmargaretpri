### P3 Science Learning Journey (Zoo)

##### 10 July 2023

As part of experiential learning, the science department organised a learning journey for the Primary 3 students to the Singapore Zoo.

The students enjoyed an encounter with wildlife where they discovered what makes the zebra unique, meet the king of the Savannah-the lion and greeting the tall giraffe! The students had a great time watching the Splash Safari Show and learning about conservation. The highlight of the trip was the students participated in an educational workshop to learn about the different types of body coverings found on animals and how the body coverings help the animals to survive better in their ecosystem.

The students have been reading a lot about animals from textbook, but nothing beats encountering them in real life!
