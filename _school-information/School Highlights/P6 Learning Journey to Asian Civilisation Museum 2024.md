### P6 Learning Journey to Asian Civilisation Museum 2024

##### 15, 17, 23 May 2024

In May, the Primary 6 students went on a learning journey to the Asian Civilisations Museum as part of their Social Studies Museum-based Learning. The learning journey was facilitated by the knowledgeable Museum Educators.

While they were there, the students viewed ceramic bowls found in a shipwreck that was discovered in the region. They also deduced how trade around the Singapore River was like in the past. The students learnt about some customs and traditions, and saw how some people in Southeast Asia lived.

Through the stories shared, students understood the cultural and historical ties that had influence on the countries in Southeast Asia and explored how Singaporeâ€™s cultural heritage has evolved over time.
