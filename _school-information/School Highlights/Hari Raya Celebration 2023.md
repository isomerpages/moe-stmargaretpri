### Hari Raya Celebration @ St Margaret’s

##### 3 May 2023

This year’s Hari Raya celebration is based on a short skit performed by our talented Primary 3 Malay students. In the skit, two friends were sharing their personal experiences celebrating the holy month of Ramadan and Hari Raya Aidilfitri. 

In addition to the short skit, video montages of students from different races trying out the Malay traditional outfits during the recess activity and students wishing their Muslim friends ‘Selamat Hari Raya’ in the Malay Language were shown to the school.

The skit ended with a wonderful sing and dance performance by the Primary 6 Malay students.
