### P6 Learning Journey to Singapore Discovery Centre as part of Total Defence Day Programme 2024

##### 20 Feb 2024

As part of the schoolâ€™s Total Defence Day programme, a learning journey to Singapore Discovery Centre was planned for the Primary 6 students. The learning journey took place on 20 Feb 2024, in the week of the Total Defence Day commemoration. In this programme, students learnt how each of them can play their part to contribute to the security of Singapore and defend our shared way of life. Students moved from station to station and worked in groups to carry out tasks related to the six pillars of Total Defence. They also got to visit a special exhibition on Total Defence with activities that prompt them to answer the call to adventure and embrace the quest for Total Defence. It was an enjoyable day of learning for all the P6 students.
