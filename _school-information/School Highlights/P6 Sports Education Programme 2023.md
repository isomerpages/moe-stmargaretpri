### 2023 P6 Sports Education Programme

##### 13 October 2023

Inline skating can be a fun and enjoyable activity for students. Not only is it a good form of exercise, but it also helps develop balance, coordination, and motor skills. Learning new physical activities like inline skating can contribute to the overall well-being of students and provide them with a positive and active outlet. And our Primary 6 girls were introduced to Inline skating as part of their post PSLE activity.

The girls who had no experience with skating managed to skate for a short distance after the session. Those with prior experiences played some games on their skates. The girls had a great time, helping each other to balance and encouraging their friends.
