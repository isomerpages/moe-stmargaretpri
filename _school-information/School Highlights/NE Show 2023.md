### National Education(NE) Show 2023

##### 15 July 2023

The Primary 5 students had a memorable and enjoyable time at the Padang on 15 July 2023 for the much-awaited National Education (NE) Show. The buzz at the Padang showed no signs of letting up at all. The students were present in full force, all hyped up for the NE Show that was about to unfold. They were treated to an array of displays, performances, sing-along, and the beautiful finale of the fireworks.

The NE Show had made a strong impression in the hearts of the Primary 5 students. We hope that they will develop a commitment towards Singapore, bringing the nation forward and beyond. It was a day they will remember for a long time.
