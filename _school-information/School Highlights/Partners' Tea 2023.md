The Partnership Committee ended the year 2023 with heart-felt thanks for our partners who played a crucial role in partnering the school in the many enriching events organised. The parentsâ€™ enthusiasm and their unwavering commitment have helped to create meaning and enhanced experiences for our girls. We look forward to more continued partnership in 2024. 
<br>Thank you, Parents!
