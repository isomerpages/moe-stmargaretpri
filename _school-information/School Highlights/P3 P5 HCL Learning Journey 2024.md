### P3 P5 HCL Learning Journey 2024

##### 21 March 2024

P3-4 HCL students embarked on a Learning Journey at Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall, delving into the rich tapestry of traditions and heritage. Through this journey, they gained a deeper understanding of the rich history, heritage, and cultural significance of the Chinese community in Singapore, while also gaining insights into the socio-cultural diversity of the nation.

Meanwhile, P5 HCL students ventured into the world of journalism at Singapore Press Holdings, unraveling the complexities of news reporting. They grasped the power of words and the ethical responsibilities associated with media communication, reinforcing their commitment to integrity and accuracy.

Both experiences sparked curiosity and expanded horizons, enriching their educational journey at SMS(P).
