Amidst the festive spirit, the school welcomed Chinese New Year on February 9th, commencing celebrations with recess activities, including engaging iPad games and lively card-matching challenges.

In alignment with our school theme, "A Heart of Thanksgiving to Love and Serve," a group of P5 students embraced the role of gratitude ambassadors. Venturing beyond the school walls, they generously gifted oranges and Chinese New Year cards to our neighbors, fostering meaningful connections and embodying the spirit of gratitude and community service.
