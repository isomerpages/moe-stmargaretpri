### Chinese New Year 2024

##### 2 - 9 Feb 2024

Amidst the festive spirit, the school welcomed Chinese New Year on February 9th, commencing celebrations with recess activities, including engaging iPad games and lively card-matching challenges.

The day's highlight unfolded in a vibrant concert, where students joyously sang and danced to the lively tunes of Chinese New Year songs. As the festivities peaked, students concluded the day with a creative flourish, colouring personalized Chinese New Year decorations and crafting 3D cards.

In alignment with our school theme, "A Heart of Thanksgiving to Love and Serve," a group of P5 students embraced the role of gratitude ambassadors. Venturing beyond the school walls, they generously gifted oranges and Chinese New Year cards to our neighbours. Public bus drivers who serve the bus-stops outside SMS(P), were also surprised to receive tokens of appreciation from teachers. Their joy was evident as they accepted these thoughtful gifts. 

The act of extending warm wishes for the festive season left a lasting impact not only within the school community, but also with the school's partners. This heartwarming gesture strengthened the bond between the school and its extended community, fostering a spirit of appreciation and goodwill.
