### P1 Level Camp 2023

##### 3 March 2023

As part of the school Learning for Life Programme (LLP),  the PE department collaborated with the English department to introduce cheerleading to the Primary 1 girls for the Primary 1 level camp.
Aside from the physical skills it takes to stunt, jump and tumble, cheerleading teaches one the practical life skills like discipline, teamwork and goal setting, all while building confidence. The girls were taught the fundamental of cheerleading while bonding as a class during the physical segment of the camp.

Continuing with the theme of Celebrating Creativity and Sustainability from the EL Week 2023, our P1 teachers and girls used recycled papers to make their pom-poms. Through this fun activity, the girls picked up useful vocabulary and acquired sequential skills in a procedural text. Besides using their hands, the girls learnt to project their voices and articulate their cheers to the audience.

The teachers and girls demonstrated the school value of tenacity and lifelong learning as they put their heads, hearts and hands into the Primary 1 Level Camp programme. 

As the saying goes, when the going gets tough, the tough gets going! Go, St Margâ€™s, Go!
