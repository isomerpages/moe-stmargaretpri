### National Day 2023

##### 8 August 2023

Our 58th National Day celebrations was a day of joy and unity. The pupils’ enthusiasm in the hall was palpable. The morning’s programme featured the flag march-in ceremony, the Recollections film, the Education Minister's message, and several heartfelt student presentations and performances. And of course, the familiar and upbeat National Day songs. We ended the celebrations with a lively workout and the St. Margaret’s wave.
