### Student Learning Festival 2023

##### 26 May 2023

The Student Learning Festival provides students with an opportunity to pick up skills beyond what is usually taught in the classrooms. Through the festival, we hope to instill in students the joy of learning and highlight to students that lifelong learning is a journey, and that learning goes beyond the textbooks and worksheets.  Students arrived in school eager and bright-eyed, looking forward to a day with no formal lessons. 


This year, the Primary 6 students could choose which set of workshops they wanted to participate in. They had a choice between plate spinning and a life skills workshop or crochet and making a flip book. 

The Primary 5 students learnt how to code to produce an embroidered coaster with their very own designs!

</tr></tbody></table>

Other levels picked up skills from their teachers such as making ice-cream stick treasure boxes, Kumihimo bracelets, Macram√© keychains and even life skills such as learning to fold clothing and plastic bags. Students shared that they learnt to put into practice the values of tenacity and patience as the skills they were learning required them to keep persevering and trying. Many also displayed the values of charity and graciousness as they assisted their peers who needed more time and guidance to master the new skills.

Most of the students shared that they enjoyed the Student Learning Festival and looked forward to having the Student Learning Festival in 2024!
