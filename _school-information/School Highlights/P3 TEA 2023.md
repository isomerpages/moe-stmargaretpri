### Having T.E.A with Sherlock Sam The Musical!

##### 18 May 2023

At St.Margaretâ€™s School (Primary), the English Department aims to create an atmosphere of vibrancy that engages students in the learning of the English language. To allow our students to immerse themselves in the world of musical theatre, students were treated to a day of Theatre Exposure and Appreciaton, or T.E.A, for short, on 18 May 2023.

As the P3 students embarked on their journey to watch Sherlock Sam The Musical! at Capitol Theatre, the air was filled with anticipation of watching characters they have only read about come to life on stage. At students gathered at Capitol Theatre, they excitedly waited for the lights to dim, signalling the start of the programme.

Once the curtains rose, students were transported to Fort Canning as they watched how Sherlock Sam and his friends helped to solve the mystery behind the haunting sounds heard. Students were also delighted to have the opportunity to interact with the cast members during selected scenes. After the show, students also had the opportunity to take pictures with the authors of the Sherlock Sam book series, A.J. Low!

Indeed, it was an enchanting experience for our P3 students that day!
