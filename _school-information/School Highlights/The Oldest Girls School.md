We began as St. Margaret’s School, founded by Maria Dyer in 1842. We are the oldest girls’ school in the Far East. We have developed a rich heritage throughout the 180 years, nurturing a community of learners with the school motto of Charity, Patience and Devotion and school values as our guiding principles. The story of St Margaret’s reminded us -  
To Love, To Learn and Grow, To Serve – which make up the strong foundation of the school heritage. 

This year, our school celebrates 180 years in Singapore with the anniversary theme “Let our Light Shine” which resonates well with the primary school’s values of L.I.G.H.T.  To celebrate the occasion, many activities and programmes are planned for the girls and will be infused into curriculum throughout the year until Founder’s Day on 16th November 2022. 

  

We are proud to note that many of our girls who graduated had not only come back to serve the school but also paid forward through their contributions to the country. As One School and One Family Unbroken, there will be joint celebrations with St Margaret’s School (Secondary) and St Margaret’s Ex-Students Association (SMESA). 

  

We thank God for His Grace and Blessings all these years and we will we continue to seek Him in the years to come. We celebrate our 180th year with a thankful heart and a resolute spirit to carry on the good works of those who came before us, To God Be The Glory.

As part of the school’s 180th anniversary celebrations, the school carried out a level cheer competition in alignment with the anniversary theme, “Let Our LIGHT Shine” and the school motto and values. Each class took time to craft their very own version of the level cheer based on the value focus for the level. Classes took the opportunity to bond through practising and presenting their cheers through a video clip. Students had a chance to vote for the level cheer they thought would be most suitable through the Student Learning Space. Each level will make use of the winning cheer for the level as their very own level cheer to be used at level bonding activities such as camps. Congratulations to all the winners!
