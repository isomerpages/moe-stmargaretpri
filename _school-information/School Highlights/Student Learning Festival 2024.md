### Student Learning Festival 2024

##### 24 May 2024

The Student Learning Festival provides students with an opportunity to pick up skills beyond what is usually taught in the classrooms. Through the festival, we hope to instill in students the joy of learning and highlight to students that lifelong learning is a journey, and that learning goes beyond the textbooks and worksheets.  

The students arrived in school eager and bright-eyed, looking forward to a day with no formal lessons. This year, the Primary 6 students had the opportunity to decide if they would like to facilitate a workshop. We had two groups of students who facilitated two workshops, i.e. hair braiding and paper quilling. The Primary 6 students could also choose which set of workshops they wanted to participate in. They had a choice between plate spinning, hair braiding and making a flip book. The Primary 5 students learnt how to use a 3D pen and design a card which makes use of an electrical circuit! Other levels picked up skills from their teachers such as making animals with jumping clay, Kumihimo bracelets, Macram√© keychains and even life skills such as learning to fold clothing and plastic bags. 

Through the activities, students learnt to put into practice the values of tenacity and patience. Many also displayed the values of charity and graciousness as they assisted their peers who needed more time and guidance to master the new skills. Most of the students shared that they enjoyed the Student Learning Festival and looked forward to having the Student Learning Festival in 2025!
