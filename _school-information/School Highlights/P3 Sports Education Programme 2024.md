### P3 Sports Education Programme 2024 (SEP)

##### 27 Feb 2024

All P3 students had a 1-hour session learning rebounding as part of our SEP on 27 February 2022. The objective of this programme is to expose students to sports beyond our PE curriculum to increase sporting opportunities our students.

Rebounding is a type of aerobic exercise that is performed while jumping on a mini-trampoline. The students had a wonderful time learning while working out their cardiovascular system.

Some students found it scary at first but they soon learnt to relax and jump in different ways as well as how to stop after jumping at high and low levels. For those who were fearful at the beginning of the lesson, they learnt that once they had overcome their fears, they would be rewarded with a fun-filled experience. Many of the students also liked the balancing competition which required them to balance on a single leg on the trampoline.
