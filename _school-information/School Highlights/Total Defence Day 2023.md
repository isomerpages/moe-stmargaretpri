### Commemoration of Total Defence Day 2023

##### 15 February 2023

In the lead-up to the commemoration of Total Defence Day, the six pillars of Total Defence were shared with the school.  After National Pledge-Taking, Alexandra (5H) and Cecil (5H) spoke to staff and students over six mornings, elaborating on a pillar of Total Defence each time and pointed out to students how they could play their part.

Police Officers from Geylang Neighbourhood Police Centre Community Policing Unit were also invited to speak during School Assembly. They let students in on the responsibilities they carry and shared stories of their encounters with some members of the public. The contribution of the Singapore Police Force towards Total Defence cannot be understated.

To further engage students in the commemoration of Total Defence, activities were organised for them during recesses. Students participated in online quizzes meant to assess their knowledge of Total Defence. Students also put pen to paper and pledged ways they could play their part as supporters of Total Defence. To spice things up, a photo booth was set up and students used the available props and costumes and had pictures taken with their schoolmates.
 
The P6 students also went on a learning journey to the Singapore Discovery Centre and learnt of ways to protect and defend Singapore through a series of activities organised for them. May they not forget the key lessons learnt and always remember they have a part to play in Total Defence. 

Putting the fun aside, students and staff must take the defence of Singapore seriously and pledge to do what we can because Together, We Keep Singapore Strong.
