### P4 TEA @ ACT 3 International

##### 3 Nov 2023

On 3 Nov 2023, the Primary 4 students went on a learning journey as part of our Theatre Exposure and Appreciation (TEA) programme. The students attended ‘The Jungle Book’ Theatre + Drama Workshop by Act 3 International. The programme focuses on the themes of courage, belonging, acceptance, and loyalty to family. It was an impactful learning journey as the students got to experience a dramatic theatre performance followed by engaging in a drama workshop to discuss, identify, and explore the theme and messages of ‘The Jungle Book’. 

After watching the theatre performance put up by three of the actresses/ drama teachers from Act 3 International, there was a Question-and-Answer session where students got to ask the actresses questions to get to know each of them and their work better. Through this session, the students got a deeper understanding of how a drama performance was put up and some of the things the actresses do behind the scenes during the performance.

During the drama workshop, students got to use their imagination and maximise their creative potential as they pretended to be the main characters of ‘The Jungle Book’. Through games and engaging activities, students learnt to become more eager to learn about others. At the end of the drama workshop, students worked in groups to showcase a scene that depicted the characters of ‘The Jungle Book’ after ten years. Students applied what they had learnt during the workshop and presented themselves confidently.
