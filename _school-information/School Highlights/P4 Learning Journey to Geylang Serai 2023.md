While they were there, the students participated in a precinct walk through Geylang Serai Market and Food Centre. While they were there, they learnt about why Geylang Serai is a significant neighbourhood to the Malay and Muslim communities in Singapore. They also learnt about leisure activities from the past such as the games
and entertainment available in the vicinity. Through this experience, students learnt about the contributions of the Malay and Muslim community to Singaporeâ€™s development.
