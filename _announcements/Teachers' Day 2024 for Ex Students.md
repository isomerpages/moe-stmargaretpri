St. Margaret's School (Primary) is happy to welcome our ex-students back for Teachers' Day. 

The details are as follows:

Date: **29 Aug 2024 (Thu)**
Time: **11.15am to 12.15pm**
Venue: **Canteen**
Attire: **In school uniform** (exceptions: students in polytechnic and university)

We are limiting the time to 12.15pm so that teachers can leave early. 
Ex-students are not allowed to wander around the school building for safety reasons.
