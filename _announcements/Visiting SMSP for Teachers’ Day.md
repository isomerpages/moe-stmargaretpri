Dear SMSP ex-students, 

After a five-year wait, St. Margaret's School (Primary) is happy to finally welcome our ex-students to visit at 136 Sophia Road. 
We are aware that many of you are curious to find out what the school looks like on the inside. 

SMSP is pleased to inform you that as part of the visit to the school, we will arrange for a **tour** of the school building if you express interest in having one. 

For logistical reasons, the school has arranged for ex-students and former staff to visit over three sessions. 

We will only be able to cater to **200 people per session**. 

* The three slots are: <br>
		(a) 4 Sep 2025 (Thu), 11.30am-12.30pm<br> 
		(b) 21 Nov 2025 (Fri), 11.30am-12.30pm<br>
		(c) 21 Nov 2025 (Fri), 12.30pm-1.30pm<br>

* Registration opens on **25 August 2025 (Mon) at 12pm**. 

* Ex-students who have NOT registered for the visit will NOT be allowed to visit the school.  


Do take note that as our school dismissal is at 10.30am, your teachers may or may not be in school during this time.  

We will adhere strictly to the timings above. 

Do register for your visit by **1 Sep 2025 (Mon)** so that the necessary arrangements can be made. 

If you are unable to make it within the stipulated timing, you may pen your well-wishes for your teachers [here](https://go.gov.sg/smsptrsdaynote2025).

We will only accept 1 registration per person. 

You will be de-registered if you submit for different days. 

We look forward to seeing you!
