### Our School Song

In these sound walls a goodly learning frame,  
Who here abide true kindliness impart  
With steadfast love, devotion firm inflame  
The fire that waits in every heart  
  
For Charity, Patience, Devotion let's be known.  
These qualities St Margaret's shown,  
On which our school has grown.  
  
We learn to serve our God, our State, our School  
In service free for neighbour, home and friend,  
So may we keep the all embracing rule  
In care for all our lives to spend.  
  
When life brings pain, when trials us defy  
Our faith, our hope, our discipline require  
Us to withstand, respond with spirit high,  
St Margaret's, shall again inspire.



### Our School Creed

I would be true, for there are those who trust me;  
I would be pure, for there are those who care;  
I would be strong, for there is much to suffer;  
I would be brave, for there is much to dare;  
I would be brave, for there is much to dare.  
  
I would be friend of all - the foe, the friendless;  
I would be giving, and forget the gift;  
I would be humble, for I know my weakness;  
I would look up, and laugh and love and lift;  
I would look up, and laugh and love and lift.  
  
I would be prayerful, through each busy moment;  
I would be constantly in touch with God;  
I would be tuned to hear His slightest whisper;Â   
I would have faith, to keep the path Christ trod;  
I would have faith, to keep the path Christ trod.




### Our School Hymn

Our Father, by whose servants  
Our School was built of old,  
Whose hand hath crowned her children,  
With blessings manifold;  
For Thine unfailing mercies,  
Far strewn along our way;  
With all who passed before us,  
We praise Thy name today.  
  
The changeful years unresting,  
Their silent course have sped,  
New comrades ever bringing;  
In comrades' steps to tread;  
And some are long forgotten,  
Long spent their hopes and fears;  
Safe rest they in Thy keeping,  
Who changest not with years.  
  
They reap not where they laboured,  
We reap what they have sown,  
Our harvest may be garnered,  
By ages yet unknown;  
The days of old have dowered us  
With gifts beyond all praise,  
Our Father, make us faithful  
To serve and love always.  
  
Before us and beside us,  
Still holden in Thy hand,  
A cloud of unseen witness,  
Our elder comrades stand;  
One family unbroken,  
We join with one acclaim;  
One heart one voice uplifting,  
To glorify Thy name.
