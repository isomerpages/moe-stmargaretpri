### Sports Jamboree 2024

##### 8 March 2024

Under the radiant sun and amidst the laughter of eager participants, the annual Sports Jamboree on 8th March 2024 transformed the school grounds into a vibrant playground of excitement and joy.

At the heart of the Sports Jamboree was the principle of student leadership and empowerment. Guided by dedicated teachers, student leaders took charge of organizing and managing the various activities, ensuring that the event ran smoothly from start to finish. It truly was an event "run by students, for students."

The Sports Jamboree was a whirlwind of fun-filled activities and lively games. Participants took part in a diverse range of sports and challenges, from classic favorites like skipping and football to more unconventional challenges like a modified territorial invasion game involving roller boards, and a ball toss where partners catch using cones. Each activity provided an opportunity for students to showcase the skills they had honed during PE lessons while fostering a sense of teamwork and camaraderie among peers.
