### **Primary 5 Outdoor Adventure Camp 2024**

##### 1 - 3 April 2024

The 3-Day, 2-Night residential Outdoor Adventure Camp for the Primary 5 students was conducted at MOE Changi Coast Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre from 1 to 3 April 2024.

During the camp, students were involved in activities such as abseiling, challenging rope course, rock wall climbing, caving/kayaking and team building activities. These activities are co-conducted and facilitated by the Form Teachers and qualified Outdoor Adventure Educators (OAEs) from MOEâ€™s Physical, Sports and Outdoor Education Branch. 

The students were certainly brought out of their comfort zone and throughout the 3 days. They have learned to build resilience through rugged outdoor activities, forge camaraderie and social bonds through challenging common experience and develop positive teacher-student relationships through outdoor common interaction with a Big Smile !
