### Hari Raya Celebration 2024

##### 11 - 19 April 2024

The 2024 Hari Raya celebration began with a stunning exhibition in the school library, featuring beautiful pop-up displays loaned from the Malay Heritage Centre. These exhibitions provided students with an opportunity to learn more about the Hari Raya celebration in Singapore. Malay Language students from P3 to P6 played a crucial role as Malay Language Culture Ambassadors, explaining Malay culture and the significance of Hari Raya to their peers. Additionally, students interacted with the exhibits through interactive questions on iPads.

The Hari Raya celebration in the school hall featured a skit titled "Awakening Traditions" performed by the talented Wira Budaya group. Through this skit, students learned about the cultural and religious significance of Hari Raya. The performance used vivid storytelling, flashbacks, and interactive scenes to teach students about the essence of family, community, and spirituality that are integral to the celebration.
