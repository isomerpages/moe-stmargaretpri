The school's Tamil department aims to develop pupils to be able to use the language fluently and confidently in formal and informal contexts.  

  

Besides developing pupils to become passionate Tamil learners, we also focus on exposing the pupils to the Indian culture so that they can truly appreciate their roots and traditions.

  

Many programs and activities are planned and carried out in order to achieve the desired outcomes.

  

## Key Programs and Activities:



### 1) Pongal Learning Journey 2023



The upper primary students embarked on a Learning Journey to Little India during the Pongal Festival Celebration week. Students engaged themselves in different activities conducted at the premise. They had their first-hand experiences with the props and instruments which provided them with great experience and rich knowledge. The TL Department extended the cultural experience and knowledge of Pongal festival by conducting recess play for all levels in school. The Tamil students facilitated these activities and shared the significance of Pongal. They also taught the students on how toÂ 

tie flowers. Students participated actively by listening and engaging themselves in the activities.
