#### **1) P4 Level Camp**

The P4 level camp integrates Physical Education (focusing on skill-related fitness components such as coordination, balance, varying speed, pace, power, and agility) with Mother Tongue lessons by introducing students to various traditional ethnic dances. The approach enhances cultural learning and physical fitness simultaneously, as we value diverse ethnic cultures through their traditional dances. Students learn about the artistic expressions of different cultural aspects, including various dance moves, music, and props used in each dance. Each culture has its unique artistic traditions that reflect its rich heritage and values.

Our P5 students embarked on an enriching exchange program with Hong Wen School. Students from various cultural backgrounds came together, fostering mutual understanding and respect. This interaction allowed them to appreciate and celebrate their differences, forming bonds that transcend cultural barriers.

Students from Hong Wen School visited our school and SMS(P) students took the lead in sharing our rich heritage. As the visit coincides with our school's Racial Harmony Day celebration, our students also facilitated multi-racial activities and learning programmes for their Hong Wen friends.

SMS (P) students also visited Hong Wen School. They were engaged in a variety of Chinese Cultural activities. They watched drum and wushu performances by Hong Wen Students. Our students also participated in a Chinese drawing workshop where they  explored traditional Chinese art, creating beautiful pieces that reflected their newfound knowledge and appreciation of this art form.

During MT Fortnight, students learnt about how cultures and values are tied in together. For example, P6 students learnt about a historical figure and engaged in a hands-on activity to design their own kite. They not only learnt about the importance of perseverance but also had the opportunity to demonstrate their creativity.

Additionally, students also delved into the fascinating world of spices, exploring the diverse array of flavors and aromas used in different cultures. Utilizing their five senses, they embarked on a sensory journey to discover the unique characteristics of various spices. This immersive approach encouraged students to appreciate the richness of cultural diversity.

Through these activities, students not only gained valuable knowledge but also developed a greater appreciation for the values and different cultures that shape our world.

#### **7) Chinese New Year Celebrations 2024**

Amidst the festive spirit, the school welcomed Chinese New Year, commencing celebrations with recess activities, including engaging iPad games and lively card-matching challenges. The day's highlight unfolded in a vibrant concert, where students joyously sang and danced to the lively tunes of Chinese New Year songs. As the festivities peaked, students concluded the day with Chinese New Year decorations and craft hands-on activities.

In alignment with our school theme, "A Heart of Thanksgiving to Love and Serve," a group of P5 students embraced the role of gratitude ambassadors. Venturing beyond the school walls, they generously gifted oranges and Chinese New Year cards to our neighbours. Public bus drivers who serve the bus-stops outside SMS(P), were also surprised to receive tokens of appreciation from teachers. Their joy was evident as they accepted these thoughtful gifts. The act of extending warm wishes for the festive season left a lasting impact not only within the school community, but also with the school's partners. This heartwarming gesture strengthened the bond between the school and its extended community, fostering a spirit of appreciation and goodwill.
