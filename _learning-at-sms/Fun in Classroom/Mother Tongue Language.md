#### **1) Hari Raya Celebrations 2024**

The 2024 Hari Raya celebration began with a stunning exhibition in the school library, featuring beautiful pop-up displays loaned from the Malay Heritage Centre. These exhibitions provided students with an opportunity to learn more about the Hari Raya celebration in Singapore. Malay Language students from P3 to P6 played a crucial role as Malay Language Culture Ambassadors, explaining Malay culture and the significance of Hari Raya to their peers. Additionally, students interacted with the exhibits through interactive questions on iPads. The Hari Raya celebration in the school hall featured a skit titled "Awakening Traditions". Students learnt about the cultural and religious significance of Hari Raya.

#### **2) Mother Tongue Language Fortnight 2024**

During MT Fortnight, students learnt about how cultures and values are tied in together. For example, P6 students learnt about a historical figure and engaged in a hands-on activity to design their own kite. They not only learnt about the importance of perseverance but also had the opportunity to demonstrate their creativity.

Additionally, students also delved into the fascinating world of spices, exploring the diverse array of flavors and aromas used in different cultures. Utilizing their five senses, they embarked on a sensory journey to discover the unique characteristics of various spices. This immersive approach encouraged students to appreciate the richness of cultural diversity.

Through these activities, students not only gained valuable knowledge but also developed a greater appreciation for the values and different cultures that shape our world.
