#### **1) Hari Raya Celebrations 2024**

The 2024 Hari Raya celebration began with a stunning exhibition in the school library, featuring beautiful pop-up displays loaned from the Malay Heritage Centre. These exhibitions provided students with an opportunity to learn more about the Hari Raya celebration in Singapore.

#### **2) Mother Tongue Language Fortnight 2024**

During MT Fortnight, students learnt about how cultures and values are tied in together. For example, P6 students learnt about a historical figure and engaged in a hands-on activity to design their own kite. They not only learnt about the importance of perseverance but also had the opportunity to demonstrate their creativity.

Additionally, students also delved into the fascinating world of spices, exploring the diverse array of flavors and aromas used in different cultures. Utilizing their five senses, they embarked on a sensory journey to discover the unique characteristics of various spices. This immersive approach encouraged students to appreciate the richness of cultural diversity.

Through these activities, students not only gained valuable knowledge but also developed a greater appreciation for the values and different cultures that shape our world.

#### **3) P3 to P5 Higher Chinese Language Learning Journey 2024**  

P3 and P4 HCL students embarked on a Learning Journey at Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall, delving into the rich tapestry of traditions and heritage. Through this journey, they gained a deeper understanding of the rich history, heritage, and cultural significance of the Chinese community in Singapore, while also gaining insights into the socio-cultural diversity of the nation.

Meanwhile, P5 HCL students ventured into the world of journalism at Singapore Press Holdings, unraveling the complexities of news reporting. They grasped the power of words and the ethical responsibilities associated with media communication, reinforcing their commitment to integrity and accuracy.

#### **4) Chinese New Year Celebrations 2024**

Amidst the festive spirit, the school welcomed Chinese New Year, commencing celebrations with recess activities, including engaging iPad games and lively card-matching challenges. The day's highlight unfolded in a vibrant concert, where students joyously sang and danced to the lively tunes of Chinese New Year songs. As the festivities peaked, students concluded the day with Chinese New Year decorations and craft hands-on activities.

In alignment with our school theme, "A Heart of Thanksgiving to Love and Serve," a group of P5 students embraced the role of gratitude ambassadors. Venturing beyond the school walls, they generously gifted oranges and Chinese New Year cards to our neighbours. Public bus drivers who serve the bus-stops outside SMS(P), were also surprised to receive tokens of appreciation from teachers. Their joy was evident as they accepted these thoughtful gifts. The act of extending warm wishes for the festive season left a lasting impact not only within the school community, but also with the school's partners. This heartwarming gesture strengthened the bond between the school and its extended community, fostering a spirit of appreciation and goodwill.
