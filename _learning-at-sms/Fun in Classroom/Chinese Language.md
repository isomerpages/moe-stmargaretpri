#### **1) Mother Tongue Language Fortnight 2022**

  

To tie in with St Margaret's Family's 180th anniversary theme "**Let our light shine**", the theme of the Mid-Autumn Festival celebration organised by the SMS(P) Mother Tongue department put great emphasis on letting the creativity of our students shines and the importance of bonding as a school family.&nbsp;

  

The celebration started weeks before Term 3 Week 10 where our Middle Primary students made their own lanterns using recycled materials, while the lower Primary students decorated their individual animal lanterns. Our Upper Primary students also designed their own comics based on our school values.

  

During the week of Mid-Autumn Festival Celebration, the whole school celebrated with lower Primary students touring the school compound with their lanterns, and staff and students guessing riddles and making soft clay mooncakes during recesses.

The Mid-Autumn Celebration has showcased the creativity of the students, allowing them to continue to learn, grow and shine together.
