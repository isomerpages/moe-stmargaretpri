### Introduction
___________________________________________________________

The Modular Sports CCA provides students with a chance to improve their athletic abilities and refine their skills in sports movement and manipulation, focusing on football this year.

Through these recreational sports sessions, students not only acquire physical skills and theoretical understanding but also actively engage in team-based activities. They delve into fundamental football techniques like mastering athletic stances and footwork while gaining insight into the game's rules and dynamics.

Alongside refining their athletic skills, students learn school values through both individual and collective efforts, emphasizing sportsmanship. The program aims to instill a lasting enthusiasm for sports participation in students' lives.
