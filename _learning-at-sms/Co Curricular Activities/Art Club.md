### **Introduction**


The Art Club allows pupils with a shared interest in art to gather and create art. Through the weekly sessions, the pupils explore different media such as clay, paint, watercolour, ink, and mixed media. These art projects&nbsp;provide platforms for pupils to&nbsp;enhance their creativity and self-expression, and&nbsp;to gain a greater understanding of concepts, artists, their life histories, and artworks.  

To add on to their primary school art education experience, learning journeys are organised to raise pupilsâ€™ awareness about art around Singapore.&nbsp;In addition, they get to view original artworks up close as they acquire art vocabulary to express their opinions on art.

### **Objectives**  


*   To nurture an interest in art&nbsp;
*   To develop creativity and self-expression
*   To foster a love and appreciation of art&nbsp;
