### Introduction

Our mission is to see every member becoming&nbsp;a self-directed learner, an&nbsp;active contributor, a concerned citizen and a confident person as she explores science and the environment around her and comes up with creative and innovative solutions to mitigate the environmental issues raised.  
  
The club provides pupils with opportunities to learn and explore the environment through hands-on activities,&nbsp;research and investigation as well as collaboration with peers.  

### Objectives


*   To encourage students to understand the importance of 3Rs – Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
    
*   To provide opportunities for students to carry out research and exploration of the science in our environment
    
*   To nurture students to be girls of character anchored on the values of Lifelong Learning, Integrity, Graciousness, Humility, Tenacity (LIGHT) and the 21st CC skills.
    

## Activities Outline


#### 1.Semester One 2023

##### Earth Day Programme, April 2023

The Environmental Science Club members took charge of the Earth Day and rolled out exciting programmes to spread the Earth Day message.

The members organized competitions for all levels to promote the theme of Earth Day, “Invest in Our Planet”. They also planned a week-long activity to spread awareness on how the students of St Margaret's School (Primary) can help to bring about a more sustainable environment, for example, short sharing after morning devotion about Earth Day and Earth Day recess exhibition.

The members of the Environmental Science Club also put up a wonderful Assembly programme to share the plight of marine creatures due to plastic pollution, through Ariel, the Little Mermaid.

Through these programmes, students of St Margaret’s School (Primary) are inspired to be our little Eco Stewards. A Primary one student even went beach cleaning with her family after that and was invited to share her findings with the school.
