### Introduction

Our mission is to see every member becoming&nbsp;a self-directed learner, an&nbsp;active contributor, a concerned citizen and a confident person as she explores science and the environment around her and comes up with creative and innovative solutions to mitigate the environmental issues raised.  
  
The club provides pupils with opportunities to learn and explore the environment through hands-on activities,&nbsp;research and investigation as well as collaboration with peers.  

### Objectives


*   To encourage students to understand the importance of 3Rs – Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
    
*   To provide opportunities for students to carry out research and exploration of the science in our environment
    
*   To nurture students to be girls of character anchored on the values of Lifelong Learning, Integrity, Graciousness, Humility, Tenacity (LIGHT) and the 21st CC skills.
