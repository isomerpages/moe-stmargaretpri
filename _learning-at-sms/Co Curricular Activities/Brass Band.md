### Overview
____________________________________________________________


SMS(P) Brass Band plays music of different genres including classical and pop music. In the recent Arts Presentation, they played Dare to Dream by Johnson Lee (Director of Music, SAF Band) and Golden Legend Overture by Forest Butchel. The band seeks to inspire students to appreciate music through resilience and performance opportunities. Students also learn to encourage one another through games and leadership programmes during the school holidays. We aim to offer a holistic experience which encompasses music performance, breathing technique and peer mentoring.
