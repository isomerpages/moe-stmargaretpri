### Introduction

Our mission is to see every member becoming a self-directed learner, an active contributor, a concerned citizen and a confident person as she explores science and the environment around her and comes up with creative and innovative solutions to mitigate the environmental issues raised.

The club provides pupils with opportunities to learn and explore the environment through hands-on activities, research and investigation as well as collaboration with peers. 

### Objectives


●	To encourage students to understand the importance of 3Rs – Reduce, Reuse, Recycle

●	To provide opportunities for students to carry out research and exploration of the science in our environment

●	To nurture students to be girls of character anchored on the values of Lifelong Learning, Integrity, Graciousness, Humility, Tenacity (LIGHT) and the 21st CC skills.
    

## Activities Outline

#### 1. Semester Two 2023

##### ViART Competition 2023 

In Term 4 of 2023, the club members took part in the ViART Competition, titled "ARTOCHANGE - Make an artwork or design item to help form sustainable habits" in support of the Recycle Right campaign by the National Environment Agency (NEA) to encourage the 3R culture. The members made beautiful upcycled tote bags to promote sustainable recycling habits. One of our members, Celeste Chen Enqi (5 Tenacity) won 3rd prize for PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay, Best Sustainable Message Award.

#### 2. Semester One 2024

##### Earth Day Programme

In 2024 Semester 1, the Environmental Science Club members took charge of the Earth Day and rolled out exciting programmes to spread the Earth Day message.

The members organised competitions for all levels to promote the theme of Earth Day. Students of all levels participated actively in the competition and showed strong support in protecting the environment.

The members of the Environmental Science Club also planned a week-long activity to spread awareness on how the students of St Margaret's School (Primary) can help to bring about a more sustainable environment. For one week, the members did short sharing after morning devotion on how we can do our part through Recycling Right, E-waste recycling and promoting Car-Lite. They also set up an Earth Day recess exhibition to showcase some of the students’ Earth Day poster designs, upcycling projects and educate students on Climate Change and How to Recycle Right. They also engaged students in recess play. The primary 4 members shared their upcycled magnetic board games with their peers during recess and the primary 5 and 6 members conducted Recycle Right games with their peers.

Not forgetting the wonderful Assembly programme put up by the Environmental Science Club members to share how we can do our part to reduce air pollution and climate change by promoting Car-Lite. The enthusiastic members put up a skit which promoted care for the environment by relating to our daily lives and taught students how they can also help to make a difference to the environment.

##### OneEarth Challenge

The primary 4 level also participated in OneEarth Challenge (OEC), a joint venture with LTA and Living Theories. OEC is a fun and interactive programme that promotes positive ‘Walk, Cycle, Ride’ behaviour in our children and to reduce traffic congestion around our schools. It aims to create a safer, cleaner and brighter environment, and we all have a part to play! 

Our primary 4 Eco-stewards played an active role in the daily check-in to report the mode of transport and encouraging their peers to log in to OneEarth Digital World. The Masters of Ceremony successfully engaged the students and staff to participate actively in OEC. It was a resounding success with 94% unique check-in and our students are definitely the most enthusiastic participants LTA had on the OEC! Our Top 3 winners were also invited to a Tree-planting ceremony.
