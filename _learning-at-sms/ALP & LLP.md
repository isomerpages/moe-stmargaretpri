### SMS(P) ALP Framework
  

At St Margaret’s School (Primary), our Applied Learning Programme focuses on our students’ application of their communication skills from their day to day interactions in the classrooms to the ability to speak confidently to a larger audience in school and at public platforms.&nbsp;

  

Our programme focuses on the 4 key aspects of communication skills which&nbsp; are physical, linguistic, cognitive and social and emotional.
