### Events
__________________________________________________________


#### Student Leaders’ Training

During these monthly meetings, the prefects come together to learn about what it means to be a servant leader through team-building games and group discussions. They are also given the opportunity to work in teams to initiate, design and execute projects that aim to serve their fellow school mates and meet specific areas of need in the school or larger community.

#### Sports Jamboree

Student Leaders learn what it means to be servant leaders as they take the lead to facilitate the games conducted all around the school building during the Sports Jamboree. Through facilitating the games, the students learn to put into practise communication skills and what it means to sacrifice their play time to serve their fellow schoolmates.

#### Student Leaders’ Investiture

The Student Leaders’ Investiture takes place at the end of Semester 1 annually. The investiture is a ceremony which formally confers our P4 and P5 Prefects as well as our P5 CCA Leaders. During the investiture, the school honours the P6 Student Leaders for their year of service to the school. This is also when the P6 Student Leaders officially hand over their duties to the P5 Student Leaders.
