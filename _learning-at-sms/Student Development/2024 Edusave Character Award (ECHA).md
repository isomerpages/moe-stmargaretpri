### Edusave Character Award (ECHA)
__________________________________________________________

MOE introduced the Edusave Character Award (ECHA) in 2012 to enable schools to recognise students who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities through their behaviour and actions. This is part of the larger goal to foster an inclusive and stronger Singapore as we broaden the qualities and achievements to be encouraged and applauded. The award also supports our continuing efforts in nurturing pupils of good values and character, who are active contributors and concerned citizens.  
  
The objectives of the ECHA are:  

*   To send a clear and strong signal of the importance that MOE places on character and values, on par with achievements in the academic domain; and  
      
    
*   To recognise outstanding students who are exemplary in character, and who can be role models to inspire others.

  

#### Eligibility Criteria



1.  All&nbsp;**Singapore citizens**&nbsp;who have met the selection criteria and have cleared the selection process are eligible regardless of the level they are in.  
      
    
2.  Students must,&nbsp;**on a consistent basis**&nbsp;, demonstrate good character and values and be good role models to their peers. In particular, students will be identified for demonstrating the following types of qualities:

*   School motto and values:

* Charity - shows care and concern for others
* Patience - exercises self-control for others
*  Devotion - remains loyal and committed
*   Lifelong Learning - learns continuously
*   Integrity - chooses to do what is right
*    Graciousness - has good manners
*    Humility - values others above self
*   Tenacity - perseveres and is resilient

  

*   A high level of civic responsibility:&nbsp;Students who are concerned about issues in the community or issues faced by others, initiate action to address these issues to improve the lives of others, and demonstrate commitment to make a positive difference.  
      
    
*   Qualities associated with resilience:&nbsp;&nbsp;Students who have persevered despite facing difficult circumstances (e.g. financial problems, family issues, health issues), and managed to overcome the odds and still do commendably well in academic and non-academic domains. Students may be nominated regardless of their academic results provided that their weak academic results are not due to negative character traits but attributed to difficulties that go beyond the control of the student.

  

#### Nomination


The nomination period starts on 17 July 2023. Students can be nominated by staff, parents, coaches and other partners using the prescribed nomination form. In addition, they can be nominated by their peers (only P3-P6). The forms can be obtained&nbsp;[here](/files/annex a echa nomination form 2023.pdf) and P3-P6 Form Teachers.    

The form must be duly completed, signed and submitted through Form Teachers or via email&nbsp;[stmargaretps@moe.edu.sg](mailto:stmargaretps@moe.edu.sg)&nbsp;&nbsp;by 31 July 2023. Incomplete forms will be rejected.
