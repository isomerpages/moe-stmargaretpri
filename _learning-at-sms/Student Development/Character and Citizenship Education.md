*   Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is an integral part of the curriculum for all Primary 1 and 2 students. The programme offers hands-on and experiential learning through the following four domains: Sports &amp; Games, Outdoor Education, Visual Arts, and Performing Arts.

*   **The Back-To-School (BTS) Programme**&nbsp;is the schoolâ€™s start of semester programme for all levels. Through the activities, such as class and level bonding, lessons on peer support and friendship, students get to bond with each other, learn to support each other and relationship management.&nbsp;

*   **Level Camps**&nbsp;are platforms for each level to bond with the level, their classes and teachers. Through the activities in the camps, helmed by each subject, we hope to instill the Joy of Learning and the school value for the level in the students.&nbsp;Please click <a href="https://www.stmargaretspri.moe.edu.sg/school-information/school-highlights/permalink/">here</a> for more photographs.

*   **Student Learning Festival:**
    The student learning festival provides students with an opportunity to pick up skills beyond what is taught usually in the classrooms. Through the festival we hope to highlight to students that lifelong learning is a journey and that learning goes beyond the textbooks and worksheets.
