*   **The Back-To-School (BTS) Programme**&nbsp;is the school’s start of semester programme for all levels. Through the activities, such as class and level bonding, lessons on peer support and friendship, students get to bond with each other, learn to support each other and relationship management.&nbsp;

*   **Level Camps**&nbsp;are platforms for each level to bond with the level, their classes and teachers. Through the activities in the camps, helmed by each subject, we hope to instill the Joy of Learning and the school value for the level in the students.&nbsp;Please click <a href="https://www.stmargaretspri.moe.edu.sg/school-information/school-highlights/permalink/">here</a> for more photographs.

*   **Student Learning Festival:**

Through the festival we hope to highlight to students that lifelong learning is a journey and that learning goes beyond the textbooks and worksheets.
