**National Day 2022** \- Our country’s **57th year** of independence was marked with great enthusiasm and joy! This year, our school came together and celebrated in the hall with our very own performers. Colourful flags and buntings for the school’s 180th Anniversary decorated our school walls. The display of our girls’ creative and authentic work made the occasion extra special!

This year’s National Day theme **_Stronger Together, Majulah!_** was a call for all Singaporeans to forge ahead as a united and strong people towards a better future. The pre-celebration started early with the playing of National Day songs, making of buntings and colouring of Singapore flags, and an exciting National Day Preview at the Marina Bay Floating platform for our Primary 5 girls.

The celebrations began with the formal observance ceremony. All students and teachers observed the march-in of the national flag, carried by two students from Girls’ Brigade and two students from Brownies. The National Day speech was delivered by Mrs. Ko, our principal, following the flag-raising ceremony. The Recollections film was then viewed to refresh our memories of significant historical occurrences. Other noteworthy aspects of the programme included watching a video clip of the late Mr. Lee Kuan Yew's historic declaration regarding Singapore's separation from Malaysia and a brief discussion about important National Day celebrations in the past.

To kick-start the celebratory segment of the programme, our teacher emcees led the school with the SMS(P) wave. The Primary 5 students put up a skit in an effort to share about the National Day Preview with the school. Students from 2 Graciousness led the school in National Day Workout, while students from 2 Integrity and 3 Graciousness led the singing of National Day songs.  It was a memorable experience for these students as it was their first time performing on stage for the whole school after two years of Covid-19 restrictions. The programme was interspersed with fun games and quizzes to keep the audience engaged. The celebration was followed by classroom activities where students learned more about Singapore, and also received their National Day gift.

National Day 2022 was a celebration that warmed the hearts of staff and students. It marked a return to having ‘live’ celebrations in the hall, where we could once again gather as a school community to commemorate events, just like it used to be, before Covid-19. Kudos to the teachers and students who put in the time and effort to bring National Day celebrations back to the school community!
