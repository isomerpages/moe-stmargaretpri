Our P3 students participated in the P3 Sports Education Programme (SEP) on 25 May 2022. The objective of this programme is to expose students to sports beyond curriculum so that they can pick up the sports and lead a healthy life style.

  

All P3 students had a 1-hour session learning rebounding from the instructors.Â  Rebounding is a type of aerobic exercise that is performed while jumping on a mini-trampoline. The students had a fun time learning while working out their cardiovascular system.
