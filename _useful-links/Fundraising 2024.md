### Support our Peri-Upgrading Programme/Fundraising 2024

We are grateful to all well-wishers who continue to keep the school in their thoughts and prayers.

School continues to appeal to everyone’s generosity to make a donation to the School Building Fund as we are still some amounts off to raise the funds to cover the construction costs.  Our staff and students will continue to organise fundraising programmes in Term 2 and the rest of the year.  Do look out for the information sent out through PG.

Parents/Guardians who are keen to make a donation to the School Building Fund can complete and return the <a href="/files/Donation_Reply_Slip_2024.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Donation Reply Slip</b></a> to the General Office.  Cheques are to be made payable to “St Margaret’s School (Primary)”.  A tax-deductible receipt will be issued for donations of S$100 and above (subject to cheque clearance).   You can also do so through PayNow via School’s UEN.

Parents/Guardians can also consider the selected memorabilia put up for sale.  Please refer to the <a href="/files/Order_Slip_2024.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Order Slip</b></a> for the price list and how to purchase and collect. 

We look forward to your active participation and generous contribution.
