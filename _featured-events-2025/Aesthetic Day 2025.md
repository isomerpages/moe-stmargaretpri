##### Aesthetics Day 2

Our recent Aesthetics Day 2 was a vibrant showcase of creativity, collaboration and cultural appreciation across the school. The event featured a series of engaging activities designed to highlight our students’ artistic talents and to foster a deeper appreciation for the arts.

One of the key highlights was the Art Booths, thoughtfully facilitated by our very own student leaders. These booths offered hands-on art activities that encouraged students to explore colours, textures and creative expression. Our student facilitators displayed commendable confidence and leadership as they guided their peers through each activity, creating a lively and supportive environment for all participants.

Adding to the excitement were the Chinese Ethnic Drum performances, presented by our Primary 3 students. Their dynamic rhythms and synchronised movements captivated the audience, showcasing both their hard work and their growing appreciation for traditional Chinese performing arts. The performances not only brought energy to the event but also deepened students’ understanding of cultural heritage.

Overall, Aesthetics Day provided a meaningful platform for students to shine, learn from one another and celebrate the rich diversity of the arts in our school community.
