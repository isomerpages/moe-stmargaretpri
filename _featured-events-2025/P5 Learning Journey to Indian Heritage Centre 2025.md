### **P5 Social Studies Learning Journey to Indian Heritage Centre 2025**

##### 18, 20 &amp; 21 Feb 2025

Our Primary 5 students recently embarked on an exciting learning journey to the Indian Heritage Centre, where they discovered the rich history and vibrant culture of the Indian community in Singapore.

As they explored the gallery, students were captivated by the diverse exhibits showcasing traditional arts, customs, and historical artifacts. One of the highlights was learning about Cultural Medallion Award winners—talented individuals who have made significant contributions to the arts and culture in Singapore. Their inspiring stories helped students appreciate the lasting impact of the Indian community on our nation’s heritage.

The visit also featured interactive displays and hands-on experiences. Students engaged with digital installations and artifacts that traced the journey of the Indian diaspora in Southeast Asia. They explored traditional Indian music and dance, marvelled at intricate artwork, and even learnt about the rich variety of Indian spices and dishes.

This meaningful experience deepened the students’ understanding of Indian culture and its role in Singapore’s multicultural society. The trip sparked curiosity, appreciation, and respect for the diverse traditions that make our community so special.
