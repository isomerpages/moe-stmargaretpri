### **Chinese New Year 2025**

##### CNY Recess Activities - 23 Jan and 24 Jan 25 <br>CNY Concert - 28 Jan 25

Amidst the festive spirit, the school welcomed Chinese New Year during the last week of January, commencing celebrations with recess activities, including engaging CNY traditional paper-cutting craft work, CNY greetings-related iPad learning activities and photo-taking booths. The activities are held in alignment with this year’s celebration theme “A Year of Auspicious Blessings through Charity and Unity”, where students are encouraged to share blessings with one another through auspicious CNY greetings.

The celebration on Chinese New Year eve unfolded amidst engaging and creative flourish, where students created, designed and coloured personalised Chinese New Year posters and decorations for the year of the Snake. The day’s highlight reached its peak in a vibrant concert, where teachers and students engaged in a fun and interactive “Snakes and Ladders” game played by teachers and students. The students also appreciated the cultural aspects of the festival through the 24 Festive drums performance which represent the 24 festivals in a lunar calendar that guides the agricultural activities of the Chinese. The performance was meant to depict the movements of farmers and activities on a farm. It also symbolizes a fresh start to the year. The concert concluded on a high note where everyone joyously sang and danced to the lively tunes of Chinese New Year songs.
