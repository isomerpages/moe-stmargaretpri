### **P3 Social Studies Learning Journey to Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery**

##### 18, 19 &amp; 20 Feb 2025

Our Primary 4 students recently embarked on an enriching learning journey to the Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery as part of their Social Studies Museum-based Learning. Guided by the knowledgeable Museum Educators, they explored the rich history and cultural significance of Geylang Serai.

The experience began with a precinct walk through Geylang Serai Market and Food Centre, where students learned why this vibrant neighbourhood holds a special place in the hearts of the Malay and Muslim communities in Singapore. As they walked through the area, they discovered its deep-rooted traditions and the important role it has played in Singapore’s history.

At the gallery, students also explored leisure activities from the past, including traditional games and entertainment once enjoyed in the area. Through interactive displays and stories, they gained a deeper appreciation of how the Malay and Muslim communities have contributed to Singapore’s development over the years.

This learning journey provided students with valuable insights into the heritage of Geylang Serai, fostering a greater appreciation for the diversity and history that shape our nation today.
