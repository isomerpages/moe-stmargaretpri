### **P3 Science Learning Journey to Mandai Zoo 2025**

##### 17 July 2025

The Primary Three students set off on an exciting adventure to Mandai Zoo, ready to discover, learn, connect, and explore the wonders of nature.

During this hands-on learning experience, they took part in an educational program all about “body coverings of animals,” embarked on an outdoor trail, and enjoyed the highlight of the day—watching playful sea lions delightfully splashing around. Along the way, they also reflected on how each of us can contribute to protecting our oceans.
