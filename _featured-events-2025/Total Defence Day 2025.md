### **Total Defence Day 2025**

##### 5 - 17 Feb 25 

Total Defence Day is commemorated on 15 February. Total Defence Day reminds us that resilience and the ability to be prepared for and overcome crises and challenges are a key part of who we are as Singaporeans. The theme for Total Defence this year is Together We Keep Singapore Strong.

As part of the commemoration of Total Defence Day, students and personnel from The Republic of Singapore Air Force and Land Transport Authority shared with the school that everyone can play an active part in keeping Singapore safe and secure. Students watched videos and learnt how their schoolmatesâ€™ family members keep Singapore safe and strong. Students also had the opportunity to experience the simulation of an electricity disruption. Through the school-wide experience, classroom discussion and student reflection, students appreciate the need to be prepared for disruption. They also learnt how to respond and help one another calmly and responsibly in circumstances of disruption. 

During recess, students had the chance to learn more about the different pillars of Total Defence. They participated in a series of interactive activities such as puzzles, hands-on learning and quizzes at the activity booth set up by teachers and personnel from the Land Trasnsport Authority. Students learn that everyone in Singapore can work together and play our part in Total Defence to keep Singapore strong.
