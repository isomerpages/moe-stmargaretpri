### **Hari Raya Celebration 2025**

##### Hari Raya Assembly: 16 Apr 2025<br>
##### Recess Activity: 8, 9 &amp; 11 Apr 2025

The 2025 Hari Raya celebration began with a lively recess activity where students created festive Hari Raya pop-up cards. Our ML Culture Ambassadors engaged their schoolmates by sharing insights about Hari Raya through informative banners from the Malay Heritage Centre.

The celebration concluded with a delightful and interactive performance titled “Huru Haraya”, which brought laughter and learning together. Through the performance, students gained a deeper understanding of:

* The significance of the fasting month, Ramadan, and the purpose of celebrating Hari Raya (Syawal)
* The cultural norms and practices associated with Ramadan and Syawal, particularly those that emphasize family bonding and filial piety

It was a meaningful celebration that fostered cultural appreciation and community spirit among our students.
