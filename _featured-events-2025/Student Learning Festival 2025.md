### **Student Learning Festival 2025**

##### 29 June 2025

The Student Learning Festival provides students with an opportunity to pick up skills beyond what is usually taught in the classrooms. Through the festival, we hope to instill in students the joy of learning and highlight to students that lifelong learning is a journey, and that learning goes beyond textbooks and worksheets. This year, a group of Primary 6 students led their fellow Primary 6 schoolmates in facilitating a paper quilling workshop. To build their Civic Literacy and empathy, the Primary 5 students participated in a series of workshops to understand different physical disabilities. The students went on to present what they had learnt about physical disabilities in a poster on Canva. Other levels picked up skills from their teachers such as making animals with jumping clay, Kumihimo bracelets, Macram√© keychains and even life skills such as learning to fold clothing and plastic bags. Students shared that they learnt to put into practice the values of tenacity and patience as the skills they were learning required them to keep persevering and trying. Many also displayed the values of charity and graciousness as they assisted their peers who needed more time and guidance to master the new skills. Most of the students shared that they enjoyed the Student Learning Festival and looked forward to having the Student Learning Festival in 2026!
