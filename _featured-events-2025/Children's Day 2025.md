### **Children's Day 2025**

This year's Children's Day concert was truly a memorable celebration! The carefully chosen lineup of program items captivated us from beginning to end. After a touching message by our principal, Mrs Ko, we sang the "Semoga Bahagia," the Children's Day song, with gusto. Our school leaders and teachers also led us in singing the song! While our voices may not have been perfectly harmonious, the sheer enthusiasm and joy in the hall were undeniable. 

One of the highlights of the concert was the drama performance by Miss Sara, Mdm Shahirah, Mdm Siti, and the talented students from STAR CCA. The message of the drama performance and the reenactment of the drama really touched us. The "Tiny Sparks to Big Dreams" TikTok challenge was another source of immense amusement. Seeing the old photographs of our teachers was a delightful surprise. Ms Ong’s Chinese princess headgear and Mrs Chua’s Cleopatra’s pose triggered waves of laughter and light-hearted buzz throughout the hall. It was heartwarming to see our teachers in a new, more relatable light.

Just when we thought the concert couldn't get any better, our teachers, under the quirky moniker "2Cool4U," graced the stage with a high-energy K-pop dance to BTS. Their unexpected talent and enthusiasm rocked the whole hall and and sparked thunderous applause. 

The closing video montage of well wishes from our school partners, from the teachers and school leaders to the canteen vendors and security staff, was a touching and sincere gesture. Despite the lingering chuckles from the teachers' dance performance, the genuine warmth and appreciation conveyed in the video filled our hearts with gratitude.

The concert was not the only programme for Children’s Day. We had a Games Fiesta for all the levels.  The primary one and two students dove headfirst into a whirlwind of games, all thanks to their super-fun teachers who turned the playground into a mega-fun zone! The primary three and four students showed off their super-team skills in 'No Man Left Behind,' a game our teachers cooked up that was all about helping each other out and having a blast! As for the Upper Primary, the primary five and six students faced off in an epic Captain's Ball showdown, with the primary six ballers snatching the victory! But the teachers weren't about to be outdone – they swooped in and narrowly defeated the primary six champs in a nail-biting rematch. This day was, without a doubt, the best Children's Day celebration I have ever experienced!
