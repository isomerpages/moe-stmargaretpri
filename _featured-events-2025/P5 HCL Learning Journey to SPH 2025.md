### **P5 Higher Chinese Language Learning Journey to Singapore Press Holdings 2025**

Our Primary 5 Higher Chinese students embarked on an enriching learning journey to Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) Private Limited, where they gained valuable insights into the world of journalism and news reporting.
The visit began with an engaging introduction to journalism, exploring its role in society and the process of news gathering and reporting. Students learned about different types of news broadcasts, including hardcopy newspapers and online news platforms, and how they cater to different audiences in today’s digital age. They also discussed the impact of digital media on journalism and the importance of credible news sources.
During the session, students explored what makes news—the different genres and how stories are selected, written, and published. They also discovered the history of journalism in Singapore, gaining an appreciation for how media has evolved over the years.

To reinforce their learning, students participated in Chinese language games, making the experience interactive and engaging. 
The journey concluded with a guided tour of the SPH facilities, where they got a behind-the-scenes look at how newspapers are produced, from interviewing, editorial planning to printing.

This eye-opening experience deepened their appreciation for journalism, enhanced their critical thinking skills, and encouraged them to be more discerning news readers.
