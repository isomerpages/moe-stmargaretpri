### **Games Day 2025**

##### 18 Nov 2025

Games Day was one of the most exciting days of the year! Our Primary 6 cohort designed all the games ourselves using recyclable materials, with our teachers guiding us along the way. It was part of our Values-in-Action project to raise funds for the school, so we wanted everything to be fun, colourful, and meaningful.

We set up all kinds of stations. There was “Pin the Tail on the Animal,” where the little ones spun around and tried their best not to poke the wall. Another popular game was shooting at paper ducks with toy guns—we made the ducks from old cardboard, and everyone cheered whenever one toppled over. Students also bowled tennis balls at empty drink bottles that we collected, and they squealed when all the bottles fell at once. One of the funniest stations was the mystery box challenge, where players had to feel an unseen object and guess what it was. The obstacle course was a huge hit too, with children crawling under a “net” of vines stretched across the blue “sea.”

The younger students were laughing nonstop, and we had so much fun teaching them the games and promoting our booths. Their joy made all our hard work worth it!
