### **P5 Local Immersion Trip with Hong Wen School 2025**


Our Primary 5 students participated in a meaningful local immersion programme with Hong Wen School, creating valuable opportunities for cross-cultural interaction and learning. This exchange programme enabled students from both schools to connect, sparking possibilities as they stepped out of their comfort zones, explored new perspectives, and embraced the richness of different cultures.

As part of the programme, Hong Wen’s Primary 3 students visited our school and were warmly welcomed by SMS(P) students, who proudly shared about our school’s heritage and values. They also took part in our Racial Harmony Day celebrations, engaging in multi-racial activities and learning experiences such as the Rangoli activity. These hands-on opportunities sparked possibilities for a deeper appreciation of Indian culture and the beauty of Singapore’s diversity.

On 18 September, our students will visit Hong Wen School, where they will immerse themselves in a variety of Chinese cultural activities. This reciprocal exchange continues to spark possibilities for our students to gain fresh insights into Chinese heritage, strengthen cross-cultural understanding, and build friendships that transcend school communities.
