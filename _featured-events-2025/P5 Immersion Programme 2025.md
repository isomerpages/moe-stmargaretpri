### **P5 Local Immersion Trip with Hong Wen School 2025**

##### Immersion Programme at SMSP

Our Primary 5 students participated in a meaningful local immersion programme with Hong Wen School, creating valuable opportunities for cross-cultural interaction and learning. This exchange programme enabled students from both schools to connect, sparking possibilities as they stepped out of their comfort zones, explored new perspectives, and embraced the richness of different cultures.

As part of the programme, Hong Wen’s Primary 3 students visited our school and were warmly welcomed by SMS(P) students, who proudly shared about our school’s heritage and values. They also took part in our Racial Harmony Day celebrations, engaging in multi-racial activities and learning experiences such as the Rangoli activity. These hands-on opportunities sparked possibilities for a deeper appreciation of Indian culture and the beauty of Singapore’s diversity.

On 18 September, our students will visit Hong Wen School, where they will immerse themselves in a variety of Chinese cultural activities. This reciprocal exchange continues to spark possibilities for our students to gain fresh insights into Chinese heritage, strengthen cross-cultural understanding, and build friendships that transcend school communities.

##### Immersion Programme at Hong Wen School

The Local Immersion Programme at Hong Wen School provides our students with a valuable opportunity to interact with peers from another school and experience a different learning environment. During the visit, students take part in Chinese cultural games alongside Hong Wen students, gaining firsthand exposure to rich cultural traditions. They also learn more about SAP school programmes.

Through these meaningful interactions and shared activities, the programme broadens students’ perspectives, deepens their cultural understanding, and nurtures friendships across schools. It enriches their holistic development while fostering respect, appreciation, and confidence in engaging with diverse communities.
