### **Nativity Play 2025**

##### 13 Nov 2025

After many hours of planning, preparation and rehearsals, the Primary 6 teachers and students brought to life a heartwarming retelling of the Nativity story. From memorising lines and perfecting dance movements to coordinating with the music, every detail reflected their dedication. 

Moments of laughter and cheer filled rehearsals, and it was heartening to see their enthusiasm shine through. With their teachers’ guidance and encouragement, the pupils worked together to put up a memorable final-year performance. Their teamwork was evident both on and off the stage. 

The dancers impressed everyone with their graceful movements, while others helped behind the scenes with props, sets and cues. The hall was filled with the familiar tunes of Silent Night and Hark! The Herald Angels Sing, and the audience responded with warm applause. Beyond the joy and celebration, the play served as a gentle reminder of the true meaning of Christmas, the birth of Jesus.
