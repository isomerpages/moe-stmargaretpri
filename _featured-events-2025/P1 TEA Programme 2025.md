### **P1 TEA Programme 2025**

##### 2 Apr 2025

The Theatre Experience for All (TEA) programme provided Primary 1 students with an extraordinary opportunity to witness a captivating stage adaptation of Harold and the Purple Crayon at Victoria Theatre on Wednesday, 2 April 2025. This immersive experience was both intellectually stimulating and artistically enriching, fostering an early appreciation for the performing arts. Throughout the programme, students were introduced to essential theatre etiquette, learning the significance of respectful participation, attentive observation, and courteous applause, which enhanced their overall engagement and understanding of live performances. 

One enthusiastic student shared, “I loved how the imaginary drawings came alive. It made me think I can create anything if I use my imagination.” Another student added, “I loved waving my little light and feeling like I was part of the story!” Many students enjoyed the dynamic effects, saying, “It was fun watching the story come alive on stage with music, laser lights, and smoke.” One child exclaimed, “It was so cool when everyone’s lights blinked together and changed colours along with the story!” Another shared, “It felt like a party when everyone danced and waved their lights!” These moments of audience participation made the experience even more magical and memorable for the young viewers.

The production’s vivid storytelling, imaginative set designs, and dynamic performances captivated the young audience, sparking their creativity and encouraging them to envision limitless possibilities, much like Harold’s purple crayon adventures. The multisensory elements of the play enabled students to develop a deeper connection to the narrative, making the experience profoundly memorable and educational. This enriching experience helps cultivate their appreciation for the arts while providing a fun and educational day outside the classroom.

Overall, this TEA programme was an invaluable occasion, nurturing both artistic appreciation and personal growth in the young participants.
