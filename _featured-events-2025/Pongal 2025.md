### **Pongal 2025**

The Primary 4 Tamil pupils embarked on a cultural immersion journey to Campbell Lane, immersing themselves in the vibrant festivities of Pongal. The girls had the unique opportunity to witness firsthand the festive decorations, traditional crafts, and the traditional art forms. They were captivated by the vibrant display of traditional art forms closely linked to the harvest festival and the vital role of animal husbandry in traditional farming practices. This enriching experience provided the pupils with a deeper understanding of the Pongal festival and its profound significance within Indian culture.

We hope this invaluable experience foster a deeper appreciation for the rich tapestry of Indian heritage and instill a sense of community spirit within the young learners.
