### **Teachers' Day Celebration 2025**

##### 4 Sep 2025

Teachers’ Day celebration, themed Ignite Light, Spark Possibilities this year, was a dazzling event, appreciating the efforts of our teachers in their heartfelt efforts and care for us by igniting light in the students’ lives and sparking possibilities in our classrooms and beyond. 
 
Memorable moments in our celebration this year included a Jeopardy Game led by our student and class leaders in our very classroom. Upper Primary students were selected to lead the game in Lower Primary classes, providing a unique chance for them to shine beyond academic pursuits. This was followed by an hour programme in the hall led by our gifted emcees from STAR CCA. Our concert performance was an amazing lineup featuring talents beyond the classrooms. Students and teachers alike were encouraged to pursue their passions and interests whether it be physically demanding activities, musical inclinations or artistic performances. There was a Taekwondo routine to a Korean tune, and an emotional rendition of “How Far I’ll Go” from the Movie Moana and a sincere tune of “You Raise Me Up”. There was also an incredible ballet performance titled “Little London News” and a magnificent violin performance titled “Czardas” composed by Vittorii by our girls. Selected students from our Primary 4 level and student care also contributed to the concert with their lovely choral performance of “Rise Up” and “你笑起来真好看”. 

It was also incredibly heartening to see everyone in the hall enthusiastically playing and helping their teachers complete various tasks during the game segment of “Mystery Box” and “Lost &amp; Found”, bringing to attention special items our teachers carry with them into the classroom, such as their waterbottles, bags or caps. 

Our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who made this event possible, including our School Leaders for their advice and contributions, the backstage crew for their excellent technical support and all performers for their hard work and dedication!
