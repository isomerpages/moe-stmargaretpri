### **English comes alive in P1 with Mrs Wishy-Washy**

Our Primary 1 students were treated to an engaging theatrical experience when their English Language teachers brought the beloved STELLAR text "Mrs Wishy-Washy" to life through an interactive skit. The performance extended beyond the traditional narrative, incorporating audience participation that had our young learners thoroughly engaged.

The teachers' creative adaptation encouraged pupils to predict story outcomes and express their thoughts throughout the performance. Through this experience, pupils strengthened their communication skills and demonstrated their understanding of the story through active participation.

The collaborative nature of the activity fostered confidence in self-expression amongst our young learners, while making language learning both meaningful and enjoyable. This engaging experience exemplifies our school's dedication to creating immersive learning experiences that bring literature to life in our classrooms.
