### **P2 English Theatre Experience for All (T.E.A.) Programme 2025**

##### 6 & 11 Nov 2025

In the first week of November, our Primary 2 students went on a learning journey as part of our Theatre Experience for All (T.E.A.) programme. The students attended The Three Billy Goats Gruff at Drama Centre Black Box located at the National Library building, a production by The Singapore Repertory Theatre (SRT) company. Prior to this experience, our students were briefed on library and theatre etiquette and this experience provided a great platform for the students to practise these skills as most of them were experiencing a musical experience for the first time. It was a bold, bouncy musical, where bravery outsmarted the biggest trolls! 

This musical was especially meaningful with their audience participation and meaningful message of reading widely, being yourself and being brave. Our students stepped into a magical, fairytale world that was full of fun and giggles. It was an unforgettable performance featuring music and lyrics by the Laurence Olivier award-winning West-End musical theatre songwriting duo George Stiles and Anthony Drewe (Honk! and Mary Poppins). 

Afterwards, our students practised library etiquette as they visited the Children’s Biodiversity Library by S.E.A. Aquarium which was themed after sustainability and conservation. It was a wonderful day for them filled with storytelling and books.
