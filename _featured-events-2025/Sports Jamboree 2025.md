Sports Jamboree 2025 was nothing short of legendary, and this year was extra special - we held it at our brand-new school campus site! With bigger spaces, fresh new facilities, and endless excitement in the air, the atmosphere was absolutely buzzing with energy!

At the heart of the jamboree were the student leaders, who played a pivotal role in ensuring the eventâ€™s success. From managing game stations to coordinating logistics and keeping spirits high, their dedication and leadership were instrumental in creating a seamless and engaging experience for all.

Right from the opening whistle, student participants dashed, jumped, and strategized their way through a thrilling lineup of games and challenges. Whether it was speed, skill, or sheer determination, every participant gave their all, filling the new grounds with unstoppable team spirit and deafening cheers!
