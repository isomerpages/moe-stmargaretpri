### **P4 Learning Journey to Kreta Ayer Heritage Gallery 2025**

##### 9, 16 May 2025

In May, two of our Primary 4 classes embarked on a captivating learning journey to the Kreta Ayer Heritage Gallery as part of their Social Studies Museum-based Learning. This experience offered students an engaging exploration of Singapore’s rich cultural heritage.

During their visit, students delved into five traditional Chinese cultural art forms—Chinese Opera, Chinese Puppetry, Chinese Calligraphy, Chinese Tea, and Nanyin Music. Through hands-on activities, vivid storytelling, and historical artifacts, they uncovered the significance of these art forms in shaping our multicultural landscape.

Beyond the gallery, students took a precinct walk around Chinatown, where they observed the historic shophouses and learned fascinating facts about the area’s unique architectural and cultural features. They discovered how some traditional signboards in Chinese are read from right to left instead of left to right, offering a glimpse into age-old customs that continue to shape Singapore’s heritage. 

A highlight of the journey was the opportunity to try their hand at writing Chinese calligraphy with brush pens, a skill that requires patience and precision. They also enjoyed taking in the aromatic scents of Chinese tea leaves, deepening their understanding of tea appreciation as an integral part of Chinese culture.

This enriching experience has ignited curiosity and appreciation for the vibrant traditions that continue to flourish within Singapore’s heritage. While only two classes embarked on the journey this term, the remaining three Primary 4 classes will be setting off on their adventure in Term 3, ensuring that all students get to partake in this meaningful exploration of culture and history.
