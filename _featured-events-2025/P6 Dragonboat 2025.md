### **P6 Dragonboat 2025**

The Primary 6 dragonboating learning journey was an unforgettable experience for all of us. When we first arrived at the waterfront, some girls felt a little nervous about being out on the water. A few admitted that they were scared of deep water or worried about falling in. But with encouragement from our instructors, teachers, and friends, everyone bravely stepped into the boats. Bit by bit, those fears turned into excitement.

Once we started paddling, we quickly realised how important teamwork was. Every stroke had to be in sync, and we had to listen to the calls from the drummer. When our paddles moved together, the boat glided smoothly across the water. The sunny day made everything sparkle—the waves, the boats, and even our bright smiles.

The most thrilling part was the mini competition between classes. As soon as the horn sounded, the girls shouted, paddled harder, and cheered one another on. Laughter, splashes, and excited screams filled the air as each class pushed to be the first to cross the finishing line.

By the end of the session, we were tired but extremely proud of ourselves. We had learned not just how to dragonboat, but also how to work as one team—and many of us discovered we enjoyed it far more than we expected.
