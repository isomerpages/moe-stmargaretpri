### **International Friendship Day 2025**

##### 9 Apr 2025

Schools in Singapore commemorate International Friendship Day (IFD) on the 3rd Friday of Term 2 each year. This special day helps students learn about Singapore’s connections with our neighbours and beyond. The theme from 2025 to 2027, “Singapore: Forging Friendships in a Complex World”, reminds us that strong friendships and understanding across cultures remain important even in a fast-changing world.
