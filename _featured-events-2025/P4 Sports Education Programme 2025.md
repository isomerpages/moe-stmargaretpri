### **P4 Sports Education Programme 2025 (SEP)**

##### 27 May 2025

Our P4 students participated in the P4 SEP on 27 May 2025. This programme aims to expose our girls to sports beyond our PE curriculum, encouraging greater sports participation and improving their fitness.

Each P4 class had a one-hour session learning Kin-Ball from the SEP accredited instructors.  Kin-Ball is the only organized cooperative sport in the world as all players must touch the ball during offence plays, and all players must be involved during defence. It is played with an oversized, lightweight ball. What makes this sport so different from other team sports is that it is played with three teams, not just two.

Other than improving physical fitness, Kin-Ball is designed to be accessible and engaging for individuals of all abilities, promoting social interaction, skill development, and enjoyment. It also encourages teamwork. There is no one superstar: everyone gets a chance to play, and everyone must play an active role in the game.

Feedback from students:

I learnt that Kin-Ball originated in Canada and that it was invented in 1986. I have learnt a lot from this game, such as how to work together as a group to receive the ball. I enjoyed it very much as it was fun. However, some of the groups were too soft so we could not hear it when they called our group, resulting in us not moving towards the ball and receiving it in time.

I find this a wonderful programme as it keeps us active and healthy, develops our teamwork skills, and trains us to be focused in catching the ball. The part I enjoyed the most was when I got to hit the ball, it was the most fun experience for me. I really hope that we get to do this fun activity again, or have other fun activities in the future.
Through this game, I learnt that I need to have a little more tolerance, patience and understanding for my team members. I also learned the importance of sportsmanship and how to stay composed when things didnâ€™t go my way. I'm grateful for the opportunity to try a lesser-known sport, which taught me valuable lessons in patience and understanding.
