### **P6 Science Learning Journey to Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve 2025**

##### 1 July 2025

The Primary Six students set off on an unforgettable adventure to the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, a haven teeming with native wildlife.
This hands-on learning experience brought the mangrove forest to life as students immersed themselves in nature. With eyes wide and senses alert, they spotted crocodiles sunning themselves, mudskippers blending into the muddy banks, snakes slithering silently, crabs scuttling between roots, and even golden spider’s web!

It was more than just a lesson—it was nature unfolding before their very eyes.
