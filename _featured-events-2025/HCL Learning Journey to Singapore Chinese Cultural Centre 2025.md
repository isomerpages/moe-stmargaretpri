### **Higher Chinese Language Learning Journey to Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre 2025**

Our Primary 3, 4, and 6 Higher Chinese students took part in a meaningful learning journey to the Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre, where they gained a deeper understanding of the Chinese Singaporean identity and its evolution over time.

Through interactive exhibits and object-based discussions, students delved into what it means to be Chinese in Singapore. They examined the past, present, and future of the local Chinese community, gaining insights into key traditions and their historical roots.

A key highlight of the visit was the exploration of multicultural influences on food, language, and art. Through hands-on activities, students discovered how Singapore’s diverse cultural landscape has shaped local Chinese customs. They also reflected on their personal connections to these traditions in today’s modern society.

This immersive experience deepened students’ appreciation of Singapore’s rich cultural heritage and encouraged them to think critically about their own identities. It was a meaningful journey that fostered a stronger sense of belonging and understanding of Chinese culture within a multicultural society.
