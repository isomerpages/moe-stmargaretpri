### **P6 Graduation Tea 2025**

##### 30 Oct 2025

The Primary 6 Graduation Tea was a heartwarming and unforgettable celebration for all of us. We began the afternoon by sending a representative from each class to share about their class flag. Everyone cheered when 6 Tenacity explained that the heart on their flag symbolised how they would continue to love, serve, and inspire others even as they move on to their next chapter. After the flag presentations, the excitement continued with a short concert featuring performances by every Primary 6 class. Some classes danced, others sang, and all of us performed with full energy, knowing it would be one of our last moments on stage together.

The concert ended with a touching montage, showing our journey from our tiny Primary One selves—wide-eyed, shy, and carrying oversized schoolbags—to the confident graduates we have become today. Laughter, squeals, and a few sniffles filled the hall as we recognised old photos and favourite memories.

Next came a meaningful moment: each of us received a special school pin from our teachers. The pin, with the school crest and the year 2025, felt like a small but powerful reminder that we will always carry a part of our school with us.

Then it was time to feast! Teachers served us a delicious buffet filled with our favourite finger foods, and the ice cream cart immediately attracted a long line of excited girls. We spent the rest of the afternoon eating, chatting, and taking photos with our friends and teachers.

The day ended with smiles, hugs, and a few tears—perfectly marking the end of one chapter and the beginning of another.
